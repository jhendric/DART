<H1>MODULE DEFAULT_obs_def_mod</H1>
<A NAME="HEADER"></A>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<HR>
<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<P>
Beginning with the I-release of DART, a more flexible, powerful (and
complicated) mechanism for incorporating new types of observations is part of
DART. The DEFAULT_obs_def module being described here is used by the program
<em class="unix">preprocess</em> to create 
<em class="file">obs_def_mod.f90</em>.
</P>
<P>
To read more detailed instructions for adding your own new
observation types, see the documentation for
<a href="obs_def_mod.html">obs_def_mod</a>.
The process does not involve altering this
<em class="file">DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90</em> file.  Instead, new obs_def
files are specified as input to the <em class="unix">preprocess</em> program
by namelist,
and a new <em class="file">obs_def_mod.f90</em> file is generated.  The rest
of the documentation here describes the internals of how the
<em class="unix">preprocess</em> program uses the template file to
do the code generation.
</P>
<P>
Information from zero or more special obs_def modules, such as 
<em class="file">obs_def_1d_state_mod.f90</em> or 
<em class="file">obs_def_reanalyis_bufr_mod.f90</em>,
(also documented in this directory) are incorporated into the template
provided by DEFAULT_obs_def_mod. If no special obs_def files are included in
the preprocessor namelist, a minimal 
<em class="file">obs_def_mod.f90</em> is created which can only
support identity forward observation operators.  Any identity observations on
the obs_seq.out file will be assimilated, regardless of the kinds specified in
assimilate_these_obs_types.  
</P>
<P> 
This documentation file only describes the special formatting that is included
in the DEFAULT_obs_def_mod in order to guide the preprocess program. Up to 
seven sections of code are inserted into the DEFAULT_obs_def_mod from each of
the special obs_def modules that are requested. The insertion point for each
section is denoted by a special comment line that must be included VERBATIM in
<em class="file">DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90</em>. 
These special comment lines and their significance are:

<ol>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS MODULE CODE INSERTED HERE <BR>
Some special observation definition modules (see for instance
<em class="file">obs_def_1d_state_mod.f90</em>) 
contain code for evaluating forward observation
operators, reading or writing special information about an observation
definition to an obs sequence file, or for interactive definition of an
observation. The entire module code section is inserted here, 
so the resulting output file will be completely self-contained.
Fortran 90 allows multiple modules to be defined in a single source
file, and subsequent module code can use previously defined modules,
so this statement must preceed the rest of the other comment lines.
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS USE FOR OBS_KIND_MOD INSERTED HERE <BR>
Integer identifiers with a unique integer value corresponding to each
available observation kind are defined in a table in the obs_kind_mod which is
also created by the preprocessor. The use statements for these entries are
inserted here.
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS USE OF SPECIAL OBS_DEF MODULE INSERTED HERE <BR>
Some special observation definition modules (see for instance
<em class="file">obs_def_1d_state_mod.f90</em>) 
contain code for evaluating forward observation
operators, reading or writing special information about an observation
definition to an obs sequence file, or for interactive definition of an
observation. The use statements for these routines from the special
observation definition modules are inserted here.  
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS GET_EXPECTED_OBS_FROM_DEF INSERTED HERE <BR>
Special observation definition modules must contain case statement code saying
what to do to evaluate a forward observation operator for each observation kind
that they define. This code is inserted here.
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS READ_OBS_DEF INSERTED HERE <BR>
Special observation definition modules must contain case statement code saying
what to do to read any additional information required for each observation kind
that they define from an observation sequence file. This code is inserted here.
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS WRITE_OBS_DEF INSERTED HERE <BR>
Special observation definition modules must contain case statement code saying
what to do to write any additional information required for each observation
kind that they define to an observation sequence file. This code is inserted
here.
</li>
<br>
<li>
! DART PREPROCESS INTERACTIVE_OBS_DEF INSERTED HERE <BR>
Special observation definition modules must contain case statement code saying
what to do to interactively create any additional information required for each 
observation kind that they define. This code is inserted here.
</li>
