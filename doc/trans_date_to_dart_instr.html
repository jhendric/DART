<P>
Trans_date_to_dart translates a standard date and time into Gregorian and DART date/time pairs.
It will be compiled automatically by .../DART/models/cam/work/workshop_setup.csh.
It opens a pre-existing file called 'date_greg' which must be in the run directory
and which must contain a date and time on the first line, in the form
<PRE>
yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss
</PRE>
It will write out the gregorian day and time onto line 2 of the same file.
It will also write out the date in the format the CAM wants to see onto the 3rd line.
It does not require any namelist input from input.nml.
