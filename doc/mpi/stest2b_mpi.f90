program fred

! second part of stest program; tests running with named pipes
! (files which act like command line pipes).  this program is expected
! to be launched by stest2a with a system call.  it writes to the pipe.
! the main program will read what this program writes.
!
! this version expects to be able to read the task number from unit 5
! (so it must be started:  echo N | ./stest2b_mpi or the equiv)
