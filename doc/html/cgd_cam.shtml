       DAReS has successfully incorporated <strong>CAM</strong> --
       <A href="http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/"
       >The Community Atmosphere Model</A> into the DART framework.  
       It is being actively used by graduate students, post-graduates, and scientists
       at universities and research labs.  Others are only using analyses for their time 
       period and resolution of interest, produced here at NCAR using DART-CAM.
       In addition to the standard DART features described elsewhere, current capabilities 
       (J-release) include the abilities to:
       <UL>
           <LI>
           Use either the Eulerian or finite-volume core.
           </LI>
           <LI>
           Use any resolution of CAM without recompiling DART.  The standard resolutions
           of T5, T21, T42, T85, and 4x5(FV) have been tested.  
           </LI>
           <LI>
           Assimilate a variety of observations; to date the observations
           successfully assimilated include the NCEP reanalysis BUFR obs (T,U,V), 
           and research is under way to assimilate MOPITT carbon monoxide 
           (when a chemistry model is incorporated into FV CAM), 
           specific humidity, cloud liquid water, and aerosols.
           </LI>
           <LI>
           Specify, via namelist entries, 
           the CAM (initial file) variables which will be directly affected by the observations.
           This allows users to change the model state without recompiling.
           </LI>
           <LI>
           Generate analyses on the CAM grid which are of comparable quality to those produced
           by operational centers, but which have only CAM model error in them, rather
           than the model error of the centers.
           <LI>
           Generate such analyses with as few as 20 ensemble members.
           </LI>
       </UL>

       In addition to the standard DART package there is a collection of file at
       <A href="ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/pub/image/raeder/DAI"
       >ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/pub/image/raeder/DAI</A> 
       either needed or helpful for interfacing CAM with DART and with 
       setting up assimilation experiments.
       More information and instructions are available in the 
       <em class=file>DART/models/cam/model_mod.html</em> documentation.

       History has shown that it is a very good idea to make sure your 
       run-time environment has the following:
       <pre>
       limit stacksize unlimited
       limit datasize unlimited
       </pre>
