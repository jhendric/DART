       DAReS has successfully incorporated <strong>CAM</strong> --
       <A href="http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/"
       >The Community Atmosphere Model</A> -- into the DART framework.  
       It is being actively used by graduate students, post-graduates, and scientists
       at universities and research labs.  Others are only using analyses for their time 
       period and resolution of interest, produced here at NCAR using DART-CAM.
       In addition to the standard DART features described elsewhere, current capabilities 
       (Jamaica-release) include the abilities to:</P>
       <UL>
           <LI>Use either the Eulerian or finite-volume core.</LI>
           <LI>Use any resolution of CAM without recompiling DART.
               The standard resolutions of T21, T42, T85, 
               FV 2x2.5 and 4x5 have been tested.</LI>
           <LI>Assimilate a variety of observations; to date the observations
	       successfully assimilated include the NCEP reanalysis BUFR obs 
               (T,U,V), Global Positioning System radio occultation obs, and 
	       MOPITT carbon monoxide (when a chemistry model is incorporated 
	       into FV CAM).  Research is under way to assimilate surface 
	       observations, specific humidity, cloud liquid water, and aerosols.</LI>
           <LI>Specify, via namelist entries, the CAM (initial file) variables 
	       which will be directly affected by the observations.  This allows 
	       users to change the model state without recompiling.</LI>
           <LI>Generate analyses on the CAM grid which are of comparable quality 
	       to those produced by operational centers, but which have only CAM 
	       model error in them, rather than the model error of the models 
	       used at the centers.</LI>
           <LI>Generate such analyses with as few as 20 ensemble members.</LI>
       </UL>

       <P>
       In addition to the standard DART package there is a collection 
       of initial condition files at the large file website
       <A href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/CAM">
                http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/CAM </A> 
       that are helpful for interfacing CAM with DART. More information 
       and instructions for setting up assimilation experiments are 
       available in the <em class=file>DART/models/cam/model_mod.html</em> 
       documentation and links.

       Sample sets of observations, which can be used with DART-CAM 
       assimilations, can be found at

       <A href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets/NCEP_BUFR">
          NCEP BUFR observations </A> 
       are the most widely used. More information and instructions for 
       setting up assimilation experiments are available in the

       Experience on a variety of machines has shown that it is a very good idea 
       to make sure your run-time environment has the following:
