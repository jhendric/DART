<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
If you have been updating from the head of the DART subversion
repository, you will not notice much difference between that
and the Kodiak release.  If you are still running the Jamaica
release, there are a lot of new models, new observation types,
capabilities in the assimilation tools, new diagnostics, and
new utilities.  There is a very short list of non-backwards
compatible changes
(<a href="#Nonbackward">see below</a>), and then a long list
of new options and functions.
</P>

<P>
In recent years we have been adding new functionality to the
head of the subversion trunk and just testing it and keeping it
in working order, maintaining backwards compatibility.  We now
have many development tasks which will require non-compatible
changes in interfaces and behavior.   Further DART development
will occur on a branch, so checking out either the Kodiak branch
or the head of the repository is the recommended way to update
your DART tree.
</P>

<H2>Non-backwards Compatible Changes</H2>

<P>
Changes in the Kodiak release which are <em>not</em> backwards compatible
with the Jamaica release (svn revision number 2857, 12 April 2007):
<OL>

<LI> &amp;filter_nml used to have a single entry to control whether
to read in both the inflation values and standard deviations 
from a file or use the settings in the namelist.  The old namelist
item, <em class=code>inf_start_from_file</em>, has been replaced by
two items that allow the inflation values and the standard deviation
to be read in separately.  The new namelist items are
<em class=code>inf_initial_from_file</em> and 
<em class=code>inf_sd_initial_from_file</em>.  See the
<a href="../../filter/filter.html#Namelist">filter namelist</a>
documentation for more details.
</LI>

<LI>The WRF/DART converter program used to be called
<em class=program>dart_tf_wrf</em>, had no namelist, 
and you entered <tt>T</tt> or <tt>F</tt> to indicate 
which direction you were converting.  Now we have
<a href="../../models/wrf/WRF_DART_utilities/dart_to_wrf.html">wrf_to_dart</a> 
and
<a href="../../models/wrf/WRF_DART_utilities/dart_to_wrf.html">dart_to_wrf</a> 
each with a namelist to control various options.
</LI>

<LI>The CAM/DART converter programs used to be called
<em class=program>trans_sv_pv</em> and <em class=program>trans_pv_sv</em>, 
with no namelists, and with several specialized variants 
(e.g. <em class=program>trans_pv_sv_time0</em>).
Now we have 
<a href="../../models/cam/cam_to_dart.html">cam_to_dart</a> and 
<a href="../../models/cam/dart_to_cam.html">dart_to_cam</a>, each with
a namelist to control various options.
</LI>

<LI>The <em class=code>obs_def_radar_mod.f90</em> radar observation
module was completely rewritten and the namelist has changed substantially.
See the <a href="../../obs_def/obs_def_radar_mod.html">module documentation</a> 
for details.

For example, the defaults for the old code were:
<pre><tt>
&amp;obs_def_radar_mod_nml
   convert_to_dbz            =  .true. ,
   dbz_threshold             =   0.001 ,
   apply_ref_limit_to_obs    = .false. ,
   reflectivity_limit_obs    =     0.0 ,
   lowest_reflectivity_obs   = -888888.0,
   apply_ref_limit_to_state  = .false. ,
   reflectivity_limit_state  =     0.0 ,
   lowest_reflectivity_state = -888888.0 /
</tt></pre>

and the new ones are:

<pre><tt>
&amp;obs_def_radar_mod_nml
   apply_ref_limit_to_obs     =  .true. ,
   reflectivity_limit_obs     =     0.0 ,
   lowest_reflectivity_obs    =     0.0 ,
   apply_ref_limit_to_fwd_op  =  .true. ,
   reflectivity_limit_fwd_op  =     0.0 ,
   lowest_reflectivity_fwd_op =     0.0 ,
   dielectric_factor          =   0.224 ,
   n0_rain                    =   8.0e6 ,
   n0_graupel                 =   4.0e6 ,
   n0_snow                    =   3.0e6 ,
   rho_rain                   =  1000.0 ,
   rho_graupel                =   400.0 ,
   rho_snow                   =   100.0 ,
   allow_wet_graupel          = .false.,
   microphysics_type          =       3 ,
   allow_dbztowt_conv         = .false. /
</tt></pre>
</LI>


<LI>The WRF &amp;model_mod namelist has changed.  It now
requires a <em class=code>wrf_state_variables</em> list to choose which
WRF fields are put into the state vector.  The order of the
field names in the list sets the order of the fields in the
state vector.  See the
<a href="../../models/wrf/model_mod.html#Namelist">WRF model_mod</a> 
documentation for details.  Although they haven't been removed
from the namelist, the following items have no effect
on the code anymore:

<UL>
<LI>num_moist_vars</LI>
<LI>surf_obs</LI>
<LI>soil_data</LI>
<LI>h_diab</LI>
</UL

</LI>

<LI>The WRF model_mod now computes geometric heights
instead of geopotential heights.  It also uses the staggered
grids as read in from the <em class=file>wrfinput_dNN</em> file(s) 
instead of interpolating in the non-staggered grid to get
individual cell corners.
</LI>

<LI>The code in <em class=file>filter.f90</em> was corrected 
to match the documentation for how the namelist item
<a href="../../filter/filter.html#Namelist">
<em class=code>input_qc_threshold</em></a> is handled.
In the Jamaica release, observations with 
incoming data QC values greater than
or equal to the namelist setting were discarded.  
Now only incoming data QC values greater than the 
<em class=code>input_qc_threshold</em> are discarded 
(values equal to the threshold are now kept).
</LI>

<LI>The <em class=program>merge_obs_seq</em> utility
has been replaced by the more comprehensive
<a href="../../obs_sequence/obs_sequence_tool.html">
<em class=program>obs_sequence_tool</em></a> utility.
</LI>

<LI>The prepbufr observation converter was located in the
<em class=file>DART/ncep_obs</em> directory in the
last release.   It has been moved to be with the other
programs that convert various types of observation files
into DART format.  It is now located in 
<em class=file>DART/observations/NCEP</em>.
</LI>

<LI>The sampling error correction generator program in
<em class=file>DART/system_simulation</em> now has a 
namelist &amp;full_error_nml.  See the
<a href="../../system_simulation/system_simulation.html">documentation</a>
for more details.  Tables for 40 common ensemble sizes are
pregenerated in the 
<em class=file>DART/system_simulation/final_full_precomputed_tables</em> 
directory.
</LI>

<LI>Most <em class=file>work</em> directories now have 
a <em class=program>quickbuild.csh</em> script
which recompiles all the executables
instead of a 
<em class=program>workshop_setup.csh</em> script.  
(Those directories used in the tutorial have both.)  
To control whether <em class=program>filter</em> is
compiled with or without MPI (as a parallel program or
not) the <em class=program>quickbuild.csh</em> script
takes the optional arguments <em class=code>-mpi</em> or
<em class=code>-nompi</em>.
</LI>

<LI>The <em class=program>preprocess</em> program was 
changed so that any obs_def files with module definitions
are directly included in the single 
<em class=file>obs_def_mod.f90</em> file.
This means that as you add and delete obs_def modules 
from your &amp;preprocess_nml namelist and rerun 
<em class=program>preprocess</em> you no longer have to 
add and delete different obs_def modules from your 
<em class=file>path_names_*</em> files.
</LI>

<LI>The utilities module now calls a function in the mpi_utilities code to
exit MPI jobs cleanly.  This requires that non-mpi programs now
include the <em class=file>null_mpi_utilities_mod.f90</em> file 
in their <em class=file>path_names_*</em> files.
</LI>

<LI>The <em class=file>DART/mpi_utilities</em> directory as distributed 
now works with all compilers except for gfortran.  In <em class=file>
DART/mpi_utilities</em> is a <em class=program>./fixsystem</em> script that
when executed will change the source files so they will compile with gfortran.
Previous releases compiled with gfortran as distributed but
no other compilers.
</LI>

<LI>The GPS Radio Occultation observation forward operator code now
requires a namelist, <em class=code>&amp;obs_def_gps_nml</em>.  See the
<a href="../../obs_def/obs_def_gps_mod.html#Namelist">GPS documentation</a> 
for details on what to add.  All <em class=file>input.nml</em> files in
the repository have had this added if they have the GPS module in their
<em class=code>&amp;preprocess_nml</em> namelist.
</LI>

</OL>

<LI>Inflation Damping</LI>
    <UL><LI>Handles the case where observation density is irregular in time,
        e.g. areas which were densely observed at one point are no longer
        observed.  Adaptive inflation values can grow large where the observations
        are dense, and if that region is no longer observed the inflation is
        not recomputed.  Inflation damping shrinks the inflation values and
        compensates for this. See the <a href="../../filter/filter.html#Inflation">

some observations and state variables at higher latitudes might not be
impacted by observations which were barely within the localization cutoff.</LI>

<H2>Changed Models</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>WRF</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The WRF fields in the DART state vector are namelist settable,
with the order of the names in the namelist controlling the order
in the state vector.  No assumptions are made about number of moist
variables; all WRF fields must be listed explicitly.  The conversion
tools (<a href="../../models/wrf/WRF_DART_utilities/dart_to_wrf.html">
dart_to_wrf and wrf_to_dart</a>) use this same namelist, so it is
simpler to avoid mismatches between the DART restart files and
what the WRF model_mod is expecting.</LI>
<LI>Support for the single column version of WRF has been incorporated into
the standard WRF model_mod.</LI>
<LI>advance_model.csh script reworked by Josh Hacker, Ryan Torn, and 
Glen Romine to add function and simplify the script.  
It now supports a restart-file-per-member, simplifies
the time computations by using the advance_time executable, and handles
boundary files more cleanly.  Plus added many additional comments, and ways
to select various options by setting shell variables at the top of the script.</LI>
<LI>Updates from Tim and Glen:<br>
 - Changed the variable name for the longitude array to better
match that used in WRF: XLON_d0* to XLONG_d0*<br>
 - Added the staggered coordinate variables (XLONG_U_d0*, XLAT_U_d0*, XLONG_V_d0*, XLAT_V_d0*, ZNW_d0*)<br>
- Use the staggered variables to look up point locations when interpolating
in a staggered grid.  Old code used to compute the staggered points from the
unstaggered grid, which was slightly inaccurate.<br>
 - Added additional attribute information, supporting long_name, description
(same info as long_name which is the standard, but WRF calls this attribute
'description'), units (previously supported) and named coordinates for the X
and Y directions (in keeping with WRF, we do not name the vertical coordinate).
</LI>
<LI>New scripts to generate LBC (lateral boundary condition) files
for WRF runs.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>CAM</LI>
<UL>
<LI>support for versions 4 and 5 of CAM, including tar files of changes
that must be made to the CAM source tree and incorporated into the CAM

<LI>use CLM restart file instead of initial file</LI>
<LI>various scripting changes to support archiving </LI>
<LI>save information from CAM for ocean and land forcing</LI>
<LI>scripts to archive months of obs_seq.finals</LI>
<LI>Added the changes needed to the CAM build tree for CAM 4.0.x</LI>
<LI>Updates to CAM documentation to bring it in sync with the
current code.</LI>
<LI>All trans routines replaced with: dart_to_cam, cam_to_dart,
and advance_time.</LI>
<LI>Minor changes to CAM model_mod, including adding a routine to
write out the times file so utilities can call it in a single
location, plus additional optional arg on write routine.</LI>
<LI>Most debugging output is off by default; a new namelist
item 'print_details' will re-enable the original output.</LI>
<LI>Added build support for new tools (closest member, common
subset, fill inflation) and removed for obsolete (merge obs).</LI>
<LI>The original 'trans' build files and src are now in a
'deprecated' directory so if users need them for backwards
compatibility, they are still available.</LI>
<LI>The archive scripts are updated for the HPSS (hsi) and
the MSS versions (msrcp) are removed.</LI>
<LI>The shell_scripts and full_experiment scripts are updated.</LI>

All the observation converters have moved to their own

</P>

<P>
The GPS forward operators aren't new with this release, but the code
has been revised several times.  In particular, there is a new
namelist to set the maximum number of GPS obs supported in a single
execution of filter or the obs diag program.  Generally the default
value is large enough for anything less than a couple days, but if
you are running a month or longer of diagnostics for a time series
you can easily exceed the compiled in maximum.  
See the GPS documentation for 
<a href="../../observations/GPS/gps.html">
creating GPS observation files</a>
or <a href="../../obs_def/obs_def_gps_mod.html">the forward
operator documentation</a>.
There are also heavily revised scripts which download and convert multiple days
of GPS obs at a time, with options to delete downloaded files automatically.
</P>

<P>
There are two modules to set observation error values when
creating new observation sequence files. One contains the
default values used by NCEP, and the other contains the values
used by ECMWF.  See the <a href="../../observations/obs_error/README">
DART/observations/obs_error/README</a> file for more details.
</P>

<P>
The radar module was completely overhauled and the namelist
changed substantially.  See the item above in the
<a href="#Nonbackward">non-backward compatible</a> changes 
section for details.
</P>

<P>
The scripting for converting NCEP prepbufr observations has been
improved.  There are options to enable or disable the 'blocking' conversion,
to create 6 hour or daily output files, to swap bytes for little-endian
machines, and to run up to a month of conversions in parallel if you
have parallel hardware available.
</P>

<P>
There is a <em class=file>DART/observations/utilities</em> directory
where generic utilities can be built which are not dependent on any
particular model.
