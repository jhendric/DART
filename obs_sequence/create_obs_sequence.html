<H1>PROGRAM create_obs_sequence</H1>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<P>
This program creates an observation sequence file using values read from 
standard input.  It is typically used to create synthetic observations,
or shorter sequences of observations (although there is no limit on
the number of observations).  For creating observation sequence files
directly from large, real-world observation datasets, see the 
<a href="../observations/observations.html">observations</a> directory.
</P><P>
This program can be run interactively (input from a terminal), or input 
files can be created with a text editor, perl or matlab script, or any
other convenient method, and then run with standard input redirected 
from this file.  The latter method is most commonly used to 
create larger observation sequence files for perfect model applications.
</P><P>
The program can create complete observation sequences ready to be
assimilated, or it can create observations with only partial data
which is later filled in by another program.
Each observation needs to have a type, location, time, expected error,
and optionally a data value and/or a quality control indicator.
For perfect model applications, it is usually convenient to define 0
quality control fields and 0 copies of the data for each observation. 
The output of create_obs_sequence can be read by 
<a href="../perfect_model_obs/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model_obs</a> 
which will then create a synthetic (perfect_model) observation sequence 
complete with two copies of the data for each observation: the observed 
value and the 'true' value.
</P><P>
Another common approach for perfect model applications is to use 
create_obs_sequence to define a set of observation locations and types,
and where observations will be repeatedly sampled in time.
When running create_obs_sequence, specify a single observation for
each different location and type, with 0 copies of data and giving
all the observations the same time.
Then the program 
<a href="create_fixed_network_seq.html">create_fixed_network_seq</a>
can read the output of create_obs_sequence
and create an observation sequence file that will contain the set of 
input observations at a number of different times.
This models a fixed observation station, observing the system at
some frequency in time.
</P><P>
This program can also create what are called "identity observations".
These are observations located directly at one of the state variables,
so that computing the value requires no model interpolation but simply
returns the actual state variable value.  To specify these types of
observations, the convention is to put in the negative index number
for the offset of that state variable in the state vector.  By specifying
the index both the observation kind and location are defined by the
kind and location of that state variable.
</P><P>
The types of observations which can be created by this program is
controlled by the observation types built into the source files
created by the
<a href="../preprocess/preprocess.html">preprocess</a>
program.  The preprocess namelist sets the available observation
types, and must be run each time it is changed, and then the
create_obs_sequence program must be recompiled to incorporate
the updated source files.
