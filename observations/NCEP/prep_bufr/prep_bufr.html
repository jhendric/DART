<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Translating NCEP BUFR files into DART obs_seq.out files (input
file to filter) is a 2 stage process.  The first stage uses NCEP
software to translate the BUFR file into an "intermediate" text file.
This is described in this document.  The second step is to translate
the intermediate files into obs_seq.out files, which is done by
create_real_obs, as described in 
<A HREF="../create_real_obs.html" > create_real_obs </A>.
</P>

<A NAME="Instructions"></A>
<HR />
<H2>INSTRUCTIONS</H2>
<P>
The prep_bufr package is free-standing and has not been completely
assimilated into the DART architecture.  It also requires adaptation of the
sources codes and scripts to the computing environment where it will be run.
It is not so robust that it can be controlled just with input parameters.
It may not have the same levels of error detection and warning that the
rest of DART has, so the user should very careful about checking the end
product for correctness.
</P>

<H3 class=indent1> Overview of what needs to be built and run</H3>

<P>
More detailed instructions follow, but this section describes a quick
overview of what programs you will be building and running.
</P>

<H4 class=indent1> Building</H4>

<P>
Running the install.sh script will build the library and main executable.
You will probably have to edit this script to set which fortran compiler
is available on your system.
</P>
<P>
If you have raw unblocked BUFR files you will need to convert them
to blocked format (what prepbufr expects as input).  You will need
to uncomment the blk/ublk section in the script and build that
converter program.
</P>
<P>
If you are running on an Intel (little-endian) based machine, uncomment
the grabbufr section in the script to build that converter program.
</P>

<H4 class=indent1> One-shot execution</H4>

<P>
If you are converting a single obs file, or are walking through the
process by hand for the first time, you can follow the more detailed
build instructions below, and then run the prep_bufr.x program by hand.   
This involves the following steps:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>building the executables.
<LI>running the blocker if needed (generally not if you have
    downloaded the blocked format BUFR files).
<LI>running the binary format converter if you are on an Intel
    (little-endian) machine.
<LI>linking the input file to a fixed input filename
<LI>running prepbufr.x to convert the file
<LI>copying the fixed output filename to the desired output filename
</UL>

<H4 class=indent1> Production mode</H4>

<P>
If you have multiple days (or months) of observations that you are intending
to convert, there is a script in the work subdirectory which is set up to
run the converter on a sequence of raw data files, and concatenate the output
files together into one output file per day.  
Edit the work/prepbufr.csh script and set the necessary
values in the 'USER SET PARAMETERS' section near the top.  This script can
either be run from the command line, or it can be submitted to a batch
queue for a long series of conversion runs.
</P>


<H3 class=indent1> Installation of the NCEP BUFR decoding program</H3>

<P>
This package is currently organized into files under the 
DART/observations/NCEP/prep_bufr directory:
</P>
<PRE>
src           Source code of the NCEP PREPBUFR decoder
lib           NCEP BUFR library source
install.sh    A script to install the NCEP PREPBUFR decoder and the NCEP BUFR library.
exe           Executables of the decoder and converter.
data          Where the NCEP BUFR files (prepqm****) could be loaded into
              from the NCAR Mass Store (the script assumes this is the default location).
work          Where we run the script to do the decoding.
convert_bufr  Source code (grabbufr) to convert the binary big-endian BUFR files to 
              little-endian files, and a script to compile the program.
blk_ublk      Source code (cwordsh) to convert between blocked and unblocked format.
docs          Some background information about NCEP BUFR observations.
</PRE>


<H4 class=indent1> The decoding program: src/prepbufr.f</H4>

<P>
The program prepbufr.f is used to decode the NCEP reanalysis BUFR data into
intermediate text files. This program was originally developed by NCEP.
It has been modified to output surface pressure, dry temperature, specific
humidity, and wind components (U/V) of conventional radiosonde, aircraft
reports, and satellite cloud motion derived wind.  There are additional
observation types on the BUFR files, but using them they would require
significant modifications of prepbufr and require detailed knowledge
of the NCEP BUFR files.  The NCEP quality control indexes for these
observations based on NCEP forecasts are also output and used in DART
observation sequence files.  The NCEP PREPBUFR decoding program is written
in Fortran 77 and has been successfully compiled on Linux computers using
pgi90, SGI&#174; computers with f77, IBM&#174; SP&#174; systems with xlf,
and Intel&#174; based Mac&#174; with gfortran.
</P>

<P>
If your operating system uses modules you may need to remove the
default compiler and add the one desired for this package.  For example
</P>
<UL>
    <LI> which pgf90 (to see if pgf90 is available.) </LI>
    <LI> module rm intel64 netcdf64 mpich64 </LI>
    <LI> module add pgi32 </LI>
</UL>

<P>
To compile the BUFR libraries and the decoding program, 
set the CPLAT variable in the install.sh script to match the compilers
available on your system. CPLAT = linux is the default.
Execute the install.sh script to complete the compilations for the main
decoding program and the NCEP BUFR library.
</P>

<P>
The executables (i.e., prepbufr.x, prepbufr_03Z.x) are placed in
the ../exe directory.
</P>

<P>
Platforms tested:
The code has been tested on NCAR systems: 
</P>
<UL><LI> Coral (Aspen Systems Linux cluster), </LI>
    <LI> Ocotillo.mmm (Linux), </LI>
    <LI> Tempest (SGI running IRIX), </LI>
    <LI> Bluesky (IBM Power4 cluster running AIX).</LI>
    </UL>

<H4 class=indent1> The byte-swapping program convert_bufr/grabbufr.f</H4>

<P>
For platforms with little-endian binary file format (e.g. Intel, AMD&#174;,
and non-MIPS SGI processors) the program grabbufr.f is used to convert the
big-endian format NCEP BUFR data into little-endian format.  The grabbufr.f
code is written in Fortran 90, and has been compiled can be compiled with
the pgf90 compiler on a Linux system, with gfortran on an Intel based
Mac, and the ifort compiler on other Linux machines.  Instructions for
building it can be found in convert_bufr/README, but basically go to the
convert_bufr subdirectory, edit convert_bufr.csh to set your compiler,
and run it to compile the converter code (grabbufr).
</P>

<P>
This program reads the whole BUFR file into memory, and needs to know
the size of the file (in bytes).  Unfortunately, the system call STAT()
returns this size as one number in an array, and the index into that array
differs depending on the system and sometimes the word size (32 vs 64)
of the compiler.  To test that the program is using the right offset into
this array, you can compile and run the stat_test.f program.  It takes
a single filename argument and prints out information about that file.
One of the numbers will be the file size in bytes.  Compare this to the
size you see with the 'ls -l' command for that same file.  If the numbers
do not agree, find the right index and edit the grabbufr.f source file.
Look for the INDEXVAL line near the first section of executable code.
</P>

<P>
If grabbufr.f does not compile because the getarg() or iargc() subroutines
are not found or not available, then either use the arg_test.f program
to debug how to get command line arguments into a fortran program on
your system, or simply go into the grabbufr.f source and comment out the
section which tries to parse command line arguments and comment in the
hardcoded input and output filenames.  Now to run this program you must
either rename the data files to these predetermined filenames, or you can
use links to temporarily give the files the names needed.
</P>

<H4 class=indent1> The blocking program blk_ublk/cwordsh</H4>

<P>
The prepbufr.x program expects to read a blocked input file, which
is generally what is available for download.  However, if you have an
unblocked file that you need to convert, there is a conversion program.
Change directories into the blk_ublk subdirectory and edit the cwordsh.make
file and edit it to match your system.  Execute it and it will build
a cwordsh.x executable, which can be run with the shell-script wrapper
program cwordsh.
</P>

<P>
The shell scripts in this directory actually create both a .c and .f
file (which did not exist before), then compile them, then remove them.  If you
have problems with the compile, comment out the remove at the end of the make
script so you can see the files it is actually trying to compile.  
</P>

<P>
Note that if you can get the blocked file formats to begin with, this
program is not needed.
</P>

<H3 class=indent1> Getting the NCEP Reanalysis BUFR format data from NCAR MSS.  </H3>

<P>
The NCEP BUFR files (prepqmYYMMDDHH) can be found within the NCEP reanalysis
dataset, ds090.0, on NCAR Mass Store System (MSS).
</P>

<P>
<!-- kdr; How would I launch another window for the data web site? 
          How to change bullets to '>' prompts for commands?        -->
To find the files:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>go to the <A HREF="http://dss.ucar.edu/pub/reanalysis/" target="_blank">
    NCAR/NCEP reanalysis archive.</A></LI>
<LI>Click "Data Archive Summary" </LI>
<LI>Click "Complete Tar list of Table of Contents of All VSN's" </LI>
<LI>Look at the years you want and click on the ds090.0 next to the 
    year mark.</LI>
<LI>Find the data set you want by searching for prepqmYYMMDDHH, with
    YY, MM, DD, HH = the year, month, day, and hour you want.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The prepqm file will be grouped with others in a weekly (monthly after
2003) tar file.  Each tar file has a unique file number like "A#####".
For example, for January of 2003, the 4 MSS TAR files are: A21899, A21900,
A21901, A21902. Before 2004 these are unblocked files.  The decoding program
requires blocked version of the files.  The corresponding blocked files
are A21899.blk, A21900.blk, A21901.blk, and A21902.blk.  These names don't
appear in the web page, but are found on the mass store.  Each is about
400 Mb.  After 2003 the files without ".blk" are blocked and can be used.
They are about 1.7 Gb.  Also, after September, 2003, these files include
AIRCRAFT data (airplane readings taken at cruising elevation) but not
ACARS data (airplane readings taken during takeoff and landing).  There
are different datasets which include ACARS data but their use is restricted
and you must contact the DSS group to get access.
</P>

<P>
Change directories into the prep_bufr/data subdirectory.
From a machine with access to the MSS use
<br />
<em class=input>msrcp mss:/DSS/A##### data.tar</em><br />or<br />
<em class=input>msrcp mss:/DSS/A#####.blk data.tar</em><br />
where ##### is the data set number, to read the NCEP BUFR data tar files.
The files which include ACARS data have a read
password; to specify that to the 'msrcp' command, add the '-rpwd <i>pass</i>' 
argument (where <i>pass</i> is a 1-8 character password).
<br /><br />
You must then run the 'cosconvert' program to convert the file into a
readable tar file. 
</P>
<ul>
<li>On bluefire: /contrib/bin/cosconvert -b data.tar 
<li>On other platforms, download the appropriate version from: 
http://www.dss.ucar.edu/libraries/io/cos_blocking/utils/
</ul>
<P>
Then 
<br /><br />
<em class=input>tar -xvf data.tar </em>
<br /><br />
will yield individual 6-hourly
NCEP BUFR data files for the observations in the +/- 3-hour time windows
of 00Z,  06Z, 12Z, and 18Z of each day.  Note that DART obs_seq files are
organized such that a 24 hour file with 4 observation times would contain
observations from 3:01Z to 3:00Z of the next day, centered on 6Z, 12Z, 18Z
and "24Z".  In addition, there are some observations at 3:00Z on the BUFR
file labelled with 06Z.  Then, in order to make a full day intermediate file
incorporating all the required obs from the "next" day, you'll need the BUFR
files through 6Z of the day after the last day of interest.  For example,
to generate the observation sequence for Jan 1, 2003, the decoded NCEP
BUFR text files for Jan 1 and 2, 2003 are needed, and hence the BUFR files

are needed.
</P>

<H3 class=indent1> Running the NCEP BUFR decoding program</H3>

<P>
In prep_bufr/work/prepbufr.csh set the appropriate values of the year,
month, first day, and last day of the period you desire, and the variable
"convert" to control conversion from big- to little-endian.  Confirm that
the raw BUFR files are in ../data, or that prepbufr.csh has been changed
to find them.  Execute prepbufr.csh in the work directory.  It has code
for running in the LSF batch environment, but not PBS.
</P>

<P>
Currently, this script generates decoded BUFR text data each 24 hours
which contains the observations within the time window of -3:01 hours
to +3:00Z within each six-hour synoptic time.  These daily output text
files are named as temp_obs.yyyymmdd.  These text BUFR data files can
then be read by 
DART/observations/NCEP/ascii_to_obs/work/<A HREF="../create_real_obs.html">create_real_obs </A> 
to generate the DART daily observation sequence files.
</P>

<P>
There is an alternate section in the script which creates a decoded
BUFR text data file each 6 hours (so they are 1-for-1 with the original
BUFR files).  Edit the script prepbufr.csh and look for the commented
out code which outputs 4 individual files per day.  Note that if you
chose this option, you will have to make corresponding changes in
the create_obs_seq.csh script in step 2.
