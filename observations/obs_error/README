Eventually this directory will contain an ECMWF error module,
and any other error modules that people want to contribute.

The intent is that each file will contain a module with the
same name, obs_err_mod, and all the subroutines will have
identical names (but presumably return different values).

This way the user can change between error values by editing
the filename in the path_names_xxx files and recompiling,
without changing the code.

Thanks to Ryan Torn for the idea and initial contributions.
