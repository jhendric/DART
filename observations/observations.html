<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<P>
Real-world observations of earth-system data come from a variety of sources,
including radiosondes, satellites, ships, aircraft, weather stations, etc.  
The files in this <em class=code>observations</em> directory
can be used to convert data from a variety of native
formats into a common DART 
<em class=code>observation sequence</em> format.
</P>
<P>
The DART framework enforces a clean separation between observations
and the models they are assimilated into.  The same observations can be
used in any model which understands how to generate a value for the requested
type of observation from its state space values.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, a single, self-contained program can convert 
directly from the observation
location, time, value, and error into the DART format.  In other cases,
especially those linking with a complicated external library (e.g. BUFR),
there is a two-step process with two programs and an ASCII intermediate file.
We are currently leaning towards single-step conversions but either
approach can be used for new programs.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the original datasets are in a standard scientific
format like netCDF, HDF, or BUFR, and library routines for those
formats can be used to read in the original observation data.
</P>
<P>
The DART software distribution
includes Fortran subroutines and functions to help create
a sequence of observations in memory, and then a call to the 
DART observation sequence write routine
will create an entire <em class=code>obs_seq</em>
file in the correct format.
</P>
<!--
<P>
Describe other utils here as well - print, merge, superobs, subset, etc.  
anything that can be model independent.  Common back end.
</P>
-->
<P>
The DART system comes with several types of location modules for computing
distances appropriately.  Two of the
ones most commonly used are for data in a 1D system and for data in 
a 3D spherical coordinate system.  All the programs here assume the
<em class=code>location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90</em> 3D sphere
location module is being used.
</P>

<P>
This directory is a work in progress.  There are currently about
10 other observation sources and types which we are in the process
of collecting information and conversion programs for and which will
eventually be added to this directory.  In the meantime, if you have
converters for data or interest in something that is not in the
repository, please email the DART group.
