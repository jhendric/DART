# this script loops over days, calling the GPS convert script
# once per day.  it can roll over month and year boundaries.
#
# this script requires the executable 'advance_time' to be
# built and exist in the current directory, and advance_time
# requires a minimal input.nml namelist file (empty utilities_nml only).

#   since the reprocessed datasets lag the realtime data.  'realtime' 
#   is data from up to today's date but with less quality control.
# - dates below are YYYY.DDD  where DDD is day number in the year.
# - only select one of reprocessed or realtime for a particular
#   satellite or you will get duplicate observations.
