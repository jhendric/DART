! notes on the gps namelist items:
!  only one of file or filelist can be specified:
!   file is a single input source. 
!   filelist is the name of a text file containing a list of 
!    filenames, one per line, to convert into a single output file.
!
!  local operator is a single tangent-point calculation
!  non-local operator integrates along the ray-path
!
!  obs_levels are specified in kilometers
!  ray delta-step and top ray height are specified in meters
!
!  ray_ds and ray_htop are ignored for local operator.
!  for the non-local operator, ray_ds is the integration length
!  of each step along the ray path, starting from the tangent
!  point and going out in each of the two directions.  
!  ray_htop is the height at which the integration stops, when
!  the next end point exceeds this height.
!
!  obs_window is obsolete and should be removed from your namelist.
!  use the obs_sequence_tool to select obs within a particular 
!  time-window.
