<H1>GPS Observations</H1>
<!-- version tag follows, do not edit --><P>$Id$</P>

<P>
GPS Radio Occultation data is being returned
from a series of satellites as part of the
<a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> 
project.
The programs in this directory help to extract the
data from the distribution files and put them into
DART observation sequence (obs_seq) file format.
<br>
<br>
The COSMIC satellites measure the deviation and phase delay
in the
straight-line path of the GPS satellite signal as
it passes through the Earth's atmosphere when the
GPS and COSMIC
satellites rise and set relative to each other.
From this deviation and phase delay, vertical profiles of
temperature and moisture can be computed. 
There are thousands of observations each day
distributed around the globe, including areas which
previously were poorly observed.
</P>

<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
Data from 
<a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> 
is available by signing up on the
<a href="http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac">data access</a>
web page.
It is delivered in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.
The files we use as input to these conversion programs are
the Level 2 data, Atmospheric Profiles (filenames include
the string 'atmPrf').
</P>

<P>
Currently each vertical profile is stored in a separate file,
and there are between 1000-2000 profiles/day, so converting a day's
worth of observations involves downloading many individual files.
There are plans in place to bundle these profiles together in
a tar file to make it easier to download the raw data.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR>
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<P>
The data is distributed in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.  DART requires all observations to be in a proprietary
format often called DART "obs_seq" format.
The files in this directory, a combination
of C shell scripts and a Fortran source executable,
do this data conversion.
<br>
<br>
Optional namelist interface
<A HREF="#Namelist"> <em class=code>&amp;convert_cosmic_gps_nml</em> </A>
may be read from file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
<br>
<br>
The work directory contains several scripts, including one which downloads
the raw data files a day at a time (cosmic_download.csh), and one 
which executes the conversion program (convert_script.csh).  These
scripts make 6 hour files by default, but have options for other
times.  The input files are downloaded a day at a time.  Be aware
that each profile is stored in a separate netcdf file, and there
are between 1000-2000 files/day, so the download process can be
lengthy.  You probably want to download as a separate preprocess step
and do not use the options to automatically delete the input files.
Keep the files around until you are sure you are satisified with the
output files and then delete them by hand.
<br>
<br>
The conversion executable, convert_cosmic_gps_cdf, reads the namelist
from the file 'input.nml', but also reads an analysis time from the
terminal or the standard input unit.  This makes it simpler to convert
multiple files without editing the namelist.  The program prompts for
the time string with the required time format, 
<em class=code>yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss</em> .
<br>
<br>
The namelist lets you select from one of two different forward
operators.  The 'local' forward operator computes the expected
observation value at a single point: the requested height at the
tangent point of the ray between satellites.  The 'non-local' operator
computes values along the ray-path and does an integration to get
the expected value.  The length of the integration segments and
height at which to end the integration are given in the namelist.
In some experiments the difference between the two types of
operators was negligible.  This choice is made at the time of
the conversion, and the type of operator is stored in the observation,
so at runtime the corresponding forward operator will be used to
compute the expected observation value.

<H2>NAMELIST</H2>
<P>We adhere to the F90 standard of starting a namelist with an ampersand
'&amp;' and terminating with a slash '/' for all our namelist input.
Consider yourself forewarned that character strings that contain a '/' must be
enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the namelist.
The namelist declaration (i.e. what follows) has a different syntax, naturally.

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
Some COSMIC files seem to have internal times which differ from the
times encoded in the filenames by as much as 2-3 minutes.  If it is
important to get all the observations within a particular time window
files with filenames from a few minutes before and after the window 
should be converted.
Times really outside the window can be excluded either by setting
the 'obs_window' namelist variable, or can be trimmed later with the
<a href="../../obs_sequence/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>.
