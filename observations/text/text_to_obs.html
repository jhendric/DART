<H1>Overview</H1>

<H4>Text File to DART Converter</H4>

<P>
If you have observations in spreadsheet or column format, in text, 
with a single line per observation, then the files this directory
are a template for how to convert these observations
into a format suitable for DART use.
</P>
<P>
The workflow is usually: 
<ul>
<li>read in the needed information about each
observation - location, time, data value, observation type - from 
a data source (usually a file)</li>
<li>call a series of DART library routines to construct a derived type that
contains all the information about a single observation</li>
<li>call another set of DART library
routines to put it into a time-sorted series</li>
<li>repeat the last 2 steps until all observations are processed</li>
<li>finally, call a write subroutine that writes out the entire series to a file in 
a format that DART can read in</li>
</ul>
It is not recommended that you try to mimic the ascii file format
by other means; the format is subject to change and the library routines
will continue to be supported even if the physical format changes.
</P>
<P>
If your input data is in some kind of format like netCDF or HDF,
then one of the other converters (e.g. the MADIS ones for netCDF) might
be a better starting place for adapting code.
</P>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="DataSources"></A>
<HR>
<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
This part is up to you.  
For each observation you will need a location, a data value,
a type, a time, and some kind of error estimate.  The error 
estimate can be hardcoded in the converter if they are not 
available in the input data.  See below for more details on 
selecting an appropriate error value.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR>
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>
The <em class=file>text_to_obs.f90</em> file is the source
for the main converter program.
Look at the source code where it reads the example data file.  You will
almost certainly need to change the "read" statement to match your data
format.  The example code 
reads each text line into a character buffer
and then reads from that buffer to parse up the data items.
</P> <P>
To compile and test,
go into the work subdirectory and run the <em class=file>quickbuild.csh</em>
script to build the converter and a couple of general purpose utilities.
<em class=file>advance_time</em> helps with calendar and time computations,
and the
<em class=file>obs_sequence_tool</em> manipulates DART observation files
once they have been created.
</P>
<P>
To change the observation types, look in the 
<em class=file>DART/obs_def</em> directory.  If you can
find an obs_def_XXX_mod.f90 file with an appropriate set
of observation types, change the 'use' lines in the converter
source to include those types.  Then add that filename in the 
<em class=file>input.nml</em> namelist file
to the &amp;preprocess_nml namelist, the 'input_files' variable.
Multiple files can be listed.  Then run quickbuild.csh again.
It remakes the table of supported observation types before 
trying to recompile the source code.
</P>
<P>
An example script for converting batches of files is
in the <em class=file>shell_scripts</em> directory. A tiny example
data file is in the <em class=file>data</em> directory.
These are <em>NOT</em> intended to be turnkey scripts; they will
certainly need to be customized for your use.  There are comments
at the top of the script saying what options they include, and
should be commented enough to indicate where changes will be
likely to need to be made.
</P>

<A NAME="Decisions"></A>
<HR>
<H2>DECISIONS YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE</H2>

<H4>Time</H4>

<P>
The basic time type in DART is a pair of integers; one for
the day number and one for the number of seconds.  For some
of the simple models which aren't direct geophysical models
time can start at day 0 and increment in any appropriate
number of seconds or days.  For a model of a real-world system
it is likely to have observations with a year/month/day,
hour/min/seconds timestamp.  There are routines in DART
to convert back and forth between the (day-number/seconds) 
format and a variety of (year/month/day) calendars. 
See <a href="../../time_manager/time_manager_mod.html#time_type">here</a>
for more details on how DART stores time information and
the types of available calendars.
</P>

<H4>Error</H4>

<P>
Each observation must specify an associated error.
There is an error value per individual observation.
It can be a constant value for all observations
of that type, or it
can vary by location, by height, by magnitude of the
observed value, etc.  
This value is the expected instrument error plus
the representativeness error of the model.  
The model error includes deficiencies
in the equations representing the processes of the system
as well as errors introduced by representing a continuous
system as a series of discrete points.
While the instrument error and the representativeness error
could be specified separately, they each have the same
impact on the assimilation and can be difficult to determine
with any real accuracy.  For simplicity, in DART (and
most current assimilation software) they are
combined and specified as a single value.
</P><P>
The instrument error is generally supplied by the instrument
maker.  Sadly, however, it is frequently surprisingly
difficult to find these values.
For the representativeness error, a set of artificial
observations could be generated with the 
<a href="../../perfect_model_obs/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model_obs</a>
program and an assimilation experiment could be run to
generate an estimate of the error in the model.
In practice however most people make an educated guess
on the values of the error and then start with a larger than
expected value and decrease it based on the results of
running some test assimilations.
For these tests the namelist for the
<a href="../../filter/filter.html#Namelist">outlier threshold</a> 
should be disabled by setting it to -1 (the default value is 3). 
This value controls whether the observation is rejected
because the observed value is too far from the ensemble mean.
</P><P>
If the diagnostics show that the difference between the mean of
the forward operators and the observed value is consistently 
smaller than the specified observation error, then the error 
is probably too large.  
A too-large error reduces the impact of an
observation on the state.
If the specified observation error is too small it is
likely the observation will be rejected when the outlier
threshold is enabled, and the observation will not be 
assimilated.  It is important
to look at the output observation sequence files after an assimilation
to see how many observations were assimilated or rejected, and at
the error and spread of the ensemble mean compared to the observation
values.
</P><P>
One last recommendation: if possible, the Prior forward operator values
should be compared against the observations after several assimilation
cycles.  If you plot results using the Posterior values
it is always possible for the assimilation to overfit the
observations and look good on the diagnostic plots.  But the
actual test is to then advance the model and look at how the
forecast of the state compares to the observations.
</P>

<H4>Types</H4>

<P>
All observations have to have a specific 'type'.  
There are namelist controls
to turn on and off the assimilation of observations at run-time
by type, or to only evaluate the forward operator for an observation
but have no impact on the state.  
Several of the diagnostics also group observations by
type to give aggregate statistics after an assimilation.
Generally types are based on both the observing platform or
instrument as well as the kind of observation, 
e.g. RADIOSONDE_TEMPERATURE, ARGO_SALINITY, etc.
Each type is associated with a single underlying generic 'kind',
which controls what forward operator code is called inside the
model, e.g. KIND_TEMPERATURE, KIND_DENSITY, etc.
</P><P>
See <a href="../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.html">here</a> for more
details on how to use and add new DART types.
The DART obs_kind_mod.f90 defines a list of already defined
observation kinds, and users can either use existing observation
types in 'obs_def_xxx_mod.f90' files, or define their own.
</P>

<H4>Locations</H4>

<P>
The two most common choices for specifying the location of an
observation are the 
<a href="../../location/threed_sphere/location_mod.html">threed_sphere</a>
and the
<a href="../../location/oned/location_mod.html">oned</a>
locations.  For observations of a real-world system, the 3D Sphere
is generally the best choice.  For low-order, 1D models, the oned
locations are the most commonly used.  The observation locations
need to match the type of locations used in the model.
