These are example data files.  They need to be unzipped
and either renamed or be the target of a symbolic link
in order to be used with the converters.  See the html file
in the parent directory for more info on how to run
the workflow for the converters.

The current version of the converters automatically detects
if the input NetCDF files contain Data QC fields or not
and uses them if present.  There is a compile-time variable
that can be set to ignore all QC information.  See the
logical parameters near the top of the source files.

Unlike previous versions of these converters, they no longer
require input arguments, except for the rawinsonde converter,
which needs two logical values to select whether standard level
observations are to be output or not.
