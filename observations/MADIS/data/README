These are example data files.  They need to be unzipped
and renamed in order to be used as-is.  acars.in is an
example of the input needed for the acars program.

These are older files which do not have the Data QC fields.
To make them work with the converters, edit the converter
source files and set 'input_has_qc' to .false. and rebuild.
