<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<P>
The 
<a href="http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/">AIRS</a>
instrument is an Atmospheric Infrared Sounder flying on the
<a href="http://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> spacecraft.
Aqua is one of a group of satellites flying close together
in a polar orbit, collectively known as the "A-train".
The programs in this directory help to extract the
data from the distribution files and put them into
DART observation sequence (obs_seq) file format.
</P>
<P>
AIRS data includes atmospheric temperature in the troposphere,
derived moisture profiles, land and ocean surface temperatures,
surface emmissivity, cloud fraction, cloud top height,
and ozone burden in the atmosphere.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="DataSources"></A>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
Access to the web pages where the
AIRS data are stored is available by
<a href="http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/data_products/get_AIRS_data/">registering</a>
as a data user.
</P>

<P>
More detailed information on the 
<a href="http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/airsL2_Std.shtml/">
sounder data</a>
is available.
</P>

<P>
The data is distributed in
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/">HDF-4</a> format, using
some additional conventions for metadata called
<a href="http://hdfeos.org/software.php">HDF-EOS</a>.
There is a basic library for accessing data in hdf files,
and a variety of
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/index.html">generic tools</a>
that work with hdf files.
Besides the programs in this directory, a variety of
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/tools.shtml">specific tools</a>
targeted at AIRS data are available to help read and browse the data.
General information on using hdf in the earth sciences is available
<a href="http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/HBDOCS/hdf.html">here</a>.
</P>

<P>
Several types of AIRS data, with varying levels of processing, are available.
The following descriptions are taken from the
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/documentation/v5_docs/AIRS_V5_Release_User_Docs/V5_Data_Release_UG.pdf">V5_Data_Release_UG</a> document:

<P>
The L1B data product includes geolocated, calibrated observed microwave,
infrared and visible/near infrared radiances, as well as Quality Assessment
(QA) data.  The radiances are well calibrated; however, not all QA data have
been validated.  Each product granule contains 6 minutes of data.  Thus there
are 240 granules of each L1B product produced every day.
</P>

<P>
The L2 data product includes geolocated, calibrated cloud-cleared radiances
and 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional retrieved physical quantities (e.g.,
surface properties and temperature, moisture, ozone, carbon monoxide and
methane profiles throughout the atmosphere).  Each product granule contains 6
minutes of data.  Thus there are 240 granules of each L2 product produced
every day.
</P>

<P>
The L3 data are created from the L2 data product by binning them in
1&deg;x1&deg;
grids.  There are three products: daily, 8-day and monthly.  Each product
provides separate ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) binned data
sets.
</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The converter in this directory processes level 2 (L2) data files, using
data set <tt>AIRS_DP</tt> and data product <tt>AIRX2RET</tt> without
<tt>HSB</tt> (the instrument measuring humidity which failed).
</P>

<P>
The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a facility instrument aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. AIRS data will be generated continuously. Global coverage will be obtained twice daily (day and night) on a 1:30pm sun synchronous orbit from a 705-km altitude.

The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. Estimates of the errors associated with these quantities will also be part of the Standard Product. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 28 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at 14 atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 50 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track.

(The Shortname for this product is AIRX2RET).
</P>

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<P>
The hdf files need to be downloaded from the data server, in any manner
you choose.   The converter program reads each hdf granule and outputs
a DART obs_seq file containing up to 56700 observations.  Only those with
a quality control of 0 (Best) are kept.
<br>
The resulting obs_seq files can be merged with the obs_sequence_tool into
larger time periods.
