This is a development trunk.
This is a work in progress and may not even work ... AT ALL.

(this should stay in the README.  at some point we might
want to move the test program to a separate test directory,

There is a test program in the work directory which validates
the dipole interpolation.  It requires some data files
(about 16 Mb in size) which are not checked into subversion,
but can be found and downloaded from this web location:
