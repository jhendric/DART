This is a development trunk.
This is a work in progress and may not even work ... AT ALL.
Do not use at your own risk ... DO NOT USE!!!

When this model is supported, this file will reflect that.

(this should stay in the README.  at some point we might
want to move the test program to a separate test directory,
in which case this file needs to be updated to reflect that.)

There is a test program in the work directory which validates
the dipole interpolation.  It requires some data files
(about 16 Mb in size) which are not checked into subversion,
but can be found and downloaded from this web location:

Working on reading the BINARY grid files instead of the (nonexistent) 
netCDF ones. Getting grid sizes from restart netCDF file and must make 
hard assumptions about variable storage order. 

dart_pop_mod is being modified to read the pop_in namelist and then set things 
like the ocean dynamics timestep. Must ensure that the model_mod then uses that 
to set a valid adv_to_time ...

dart_pop_mod must also set the time_manager_nml:stop_count (and stop_option) to
the right values.

dart_pop_mod must also create a pointer file with the expected restart file as
a way to make sure the model has advanced to the proper spot.

advance_model.csh must paste the pop_in.DART namelist on top of the pop_in namelist
for model control ... 

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is how I understand (LANL) POP to work:

Given:
&init_ts_nml
   init_ts_option   = 'restart'
   init_ts_file     = 'pop.r'
   init_ts_file_fmt = 'nc'
/

The init_ts_file entry is completely ignored. A pointer file with the name
"pop_pointer.restart" contains the name of the restart file.
