This is the instructions to run pe2lyr model

1) modify "DART/mkmf/mkmf.template.pgi" so can make it run in your local system
*  take -r8 out for our portland fortran compiler

2) go to DART/models/pe2lyr/work, create make files, run make
  ./mkmf_create_obs_set_def; make
  ./mkmf_create_obs_sequence; make
  ./mkmf_perfect_model_obs; make
  ./mkmf_filter; make

3) generate one bogus ob with large error using ./create_obs_set_def

4) generate obs seq for this ob (100 days is enough since 
   model_time = 1200sec), run create_obs_sequence

5) ./perfect_model_obs ( start_from_restart = false in "input.nml"),
   use obs_seq.in.

6) cp perfect_restart perfect_ics, set  start_from_restart = false 
   in "input.nml"

7) ./perfect_model_obs 

8) ./filter (cutoff =0, cov_inflate= 1.0, start_from_restart = false  
             in input.nml)
   
* ens_size should be consistant with future run for real obs

9) cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
   cp filter_restart filter_ics
   set  start_from_restart = false for &filter_nml in input.nml

*  perfect_ics, filter_ics is very important for future test.
 test always can start from here

10) simulate obs_seq.in_151 is a file containing 362 obs for each day 
    (151 days total). 
    those 362 obs locations come from Jeff's expts,
    so test result can be compared with what we already have. 

11) change obs_seq_in_file_name = "obs_seq.in_151"
    obs_seq_out_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151"  for &perfect_model_obs_nml
    change obs_sequence_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151" for &filter_nml
    in input.nml

12) repeat step 7 and 8 with cutoff=0.25, cov_inflate=1.01,
    start_from_restart=true.
