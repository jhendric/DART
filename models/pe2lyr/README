These are the instructions to run pe2lyr model

I) To test that the model runs:

1) modify "DART/mkmf/mkmf.template" to match your system and compiler
   (copy the closest template in that directory to this name and customize it).
*  take -r8 out for the portland fortran compiler

2) go to DART/models/pe2lyr/work and run 'csh ./workshop_setup.csh'
   this creates make files and runs make to create an assortment of
   executables.  it also runs 'perfect_model_obs' and 'filter' before exiting.
   these use an existing obs_seq.in file which contains 10 observations and
   runs quickly for testing.


II) To run a real experiment, spin up the model using a single observation
    and then assimilate real observations:

3) generate one bogus ob (kind = -30) with large error ( = ??)
   using ./create_obs_sequence

4) generate an obs seq for this ob (?? the original here said use 100 days
   of obs, but didn't specify a time between obs.  i was experimenting
   with 100 time steps, each time step 3600 sec; this ran fairly slow, however.
   the model_time = 1200sec) by running ./create_fixed_network_seq

5) ./perfect_model_obs ( start_from_restart = false in "input.nml"),
   use obs_seq.in.

6) cp perfect_restart perfect_ics, set  start_from_restart = false 
   in "input.nml"

7) ./perfect_model_obs 

8) ./filter (cutoff= 0, inf_flavor= 0, 0, start_from_restart = false  
             in input.nml)
   
* ens_size should be consistant with future run for real obs

9) cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
   cp filter_restart filter_ics
   set  start_from_restart = false for &filter_nml in input.nml

*  perfect_ics, filter_ics is very important for future test.
 test always can start from here

10) simulate obs_seq.in_151 is a file containing 362 obs for each day 
    (151 days total). ** THIS FILE IS NOT CONVERTED TO THE CURRENT OBS
    FORMAT YET but will be soon ** 
    those 362 obs locations come from Jeff Whitaker's expts,
    so test result can be compared with what we already have. 

11) change obs_seq_in_file_name = "obs_seq.in_151"
    obs_seq_out_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151"  for &perfect_model_obs_nml
    change obs_sequence_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151" for &filter_nml
    in input.nml

12) repeat step 7 and 8 with cutoff=0.25, inf_flavor=3, 0, inf_initial=1.01,
    start_from_restart=true.
