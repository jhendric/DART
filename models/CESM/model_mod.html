<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
The Lanai release of DART works within the CESM framework.  The release
includes a setup script that will build the required DART executables,
build the CESM case, and copy the required initial files and
executables to the correct locations.
The CESM run script is modified during the build process so it first
runs CESM, then it runs the DART executable 'filter'.
</P>

<P>
The instructions on this page describe how to set up a coupled
CESM run when you want to assimilate observations into more than
one active component (e.g. assimilate atmospheric obs into the 
atmosphere model, ocean obs into the ocean model, and land obs into 
the land model).  If you are interested in assimilating observations
into only a single component there are more appropriate setup scripts 
in each of the model-specific pages that set up a CESM run for that component.
</P>

<P>
See these component specific model_mod documentation for information
on the namelists and requirements:

<LI><a href="../cam/model_mod.html">CAM (atmosphere)</a>
<LI><a href="../POP/model_mod.html">POP (ocean)</a>
<LI><a href="../clm/model_mod.html">CLM (land)</a>
</UL>

<P>
There are scripts in the each of the component shell_scripts directory which will
build the filter program for that single component, copy the right files
into the CESM caseroot directory, build CESM, and stage files to run an experiment
where observations are only assimilated into that component.
</P>

<P>
The rest of this page describes setting up a coupled CESM run
where you are assimilating into multiple active components.

<H2>Quickstart for CESM/DART on the NCAR 'yellowstone' machine</H2>

<P>
Both CESM and DART are large, complex software systems with a lot
of power and capability, but they will require an investment of time and effort 
in learning how to set them up and run them correctly.  The following
list includes the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to
run a CESM Data Assimilation (DA) experiment.

The basics of the information below should still apply, but things like where
the <em class=mono>SourceMods</em> are stored or where to find initial

<P>
Check out CESM version 1.1.1 (which we know is not the
most recent release - but it is the latest version we
have tested the DART code with).  We are working on 
validating CESM 1.2 with DART and will update the
code and documentation when it is ready.
</P>
<P>
Here's the user's guide for CESM version 1.1.1:<br /><br />

You will want "cesm1_1_1" as the model version.  You will have 
to register as a user to check out the source code.  There is a
default username and password to access the subversion website.

<P>
This web page shows the names of the 'compsets' which are the

<P>
If you want to try to build CESM separately from DART
to learn about it, that's fine.  But our scripts will need
to rebuild it again with the DART configuration so you can
wait on building it if you want.
</P>

<A NAME="GetPatches"></A>
<H3>Get required patches to CESM1.1.1</H3>

<P>
There are a few CESM files that we still need to modify to make
things work with DART.  In this dir on yellowstone is a tar file:<br />
<pre>
   ~nancy/cesm1_1_1_mods.tar
</pre>
Copy that to your home dir and untar it.  Our setup script will look
for this subdirectory in your home directory and incorporate these 
patches when it builds CESM.

<P>
Go to the DART web pages:  
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS</a>
and register as a DART user.  (See the 'Download DART' 
item under the 'Getting Started' menu.)
It's important for us to be able to document the size of
our user base and everyone who registers helps us out.
</P>
<P>
Check out the "Lanai" release.  The following instructions
assume you've checked it out into a subdirectory "DART".
</P>
<P>
In the DART/mkmf directory copy the 
<em class=file>mkmf.template.intel.linux</em> to 
<em class=file>mkmf.template</em> . That should work 
for yellowstone with the default set of modules that are loaded 
on that machine.   <strong>**IMPORTANT**</strong> If you
are running with an active ocean, or you might ever
sometime in the future run with an active ocean, you must add:<br />
<pre>
  -convert big_endian
</pre>
to the list of FFLAGS in the mkmf.template file.  POP uses some binary
restart files that are still in the byte order for bluefire.  If all
your restart files for CAM, CAM-CHEM, CLM, etc are NetCDF files, 
then you can leave that flag off so yellowstone writes data in 
the normal little-endian byte order.
</P>
<P> 
If you want to be able to reproduce runs exactly, you need to make
sure this flag is part of the FFLAGS line:<br />
<pre>
  -fp-model precise
</pre>
in your mkmf.template file.
It has a slight performance penalty at runtime, but it ensures
that floating point operations are executed in the same order
inside the processor chip and the results should match bit for bit.
</P>
<P>
The DART scripts for CESM are in:<br />
<pre>
   DART/models/CESM/shell_scripts
</pre>
Look at <em class=mono>CESM1_1_1_setup_hybrid.csh</em>. 
</P>
<P>
There are some things you should customize at the top, including the compset,
your project number for running, how many ensemble members, etc. Make
any changes you want there.
</P>
<P>
Run the script.  It will build the CAM, POP, and CLM filters first (the main
DART executable is called <em class=mono>filter</em>), and then
build and configure CESM.  When the script is done you should have
files in several directories. Unless you have changed these values
in the setup script, the default locations are:<br />
<UL>
<LI>
The 'cases' dir has the scripts that start and configure runtime vars
for CESM.  It also has the DART namelist files, <em class=file>input.nml</em>s, 
for the various components.  Usually we set this to <br />
<pre>/glade/p/work/${USER}/cases</pre>
</LI>
<LI>
The actual execution directory is usually <br />
<pre>/glade/scratch/${USER}/$casename/run</pre>
and the executable files themselves are <br />
<pre>/glade/scratch/${USER}/$casename/bld</pre>
</LI>
<LI>
When you've successfully run a model advance, the output files are saved in <br />
<pre>/glade/scratch/${USER}/archive/$casename</pre>
with a subdirectory for each component.  Our output files will be in the
'dart' subdirectory, and under that directory will be
'hist', 'logs', and 'rest'.  You'll find the DART diagnostic files and
obs_seq.final files in the 'hist' subdirectory.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The CESM/DART system uses the CESM multi-instance capability to run
multiple copies of components concurrently. The coupler
routes data between the corresponding instances of each component.
Each component can have N instances or 1 instance which is shared
amongst all the multi-instances of other components.
DART expects the CESM naming convension of adding instance numbers
of the form <em class=mono>_NNNN</em> following the component name, 
e.g. <em class=mono>my_case.cam_0001.r.2009-01-01-21600.nc</em>
is the first instance in a multi-instance case.  For components 
without multiple instances the names follow the usual naming
conventions, e.g. <em class=mono>my_case.cam.r.2009-01-01-21600.nc</em>.
</P>

<br /><br />
<P> </P>
<A NAME="ICSandObs"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H3>Initial Conditions and Observations</H3>
<H4>ICs</H4>
<P>
DART requires an <em class=file>ensemble</em> of initial conditions.
This is the same as <em class=file>multiple instances</em> in CESM terminology.
If you have a multiple-instance run available to you for initial condition
files, great.  If you do not, one suggested option is to make N copies of a single
initial condition file, each with the same data but with a different
filename that includes the instance number. 
(See the paragraph immediately above discussing filename conventions.) 
When you run CESM for the first step it will be advancing N identical
copies of the model.  However, when you run DART with the following
changes to the <em class=file>input.nml</em> namelist, each instance
will be perturbed differently and as the system runs these differences
will evolve into distinct instances that will remain different.
</P>
<P>
Changes to the DART <em class=mono>input.nml</em> file to perturb
identical initial conditions:
<pre>
&amp;filter_nml :: start_from_restart = .false.,
&amp;filter_nml :: restart_in_file_name = "filter_ics.0001",
&amp;ensemble_manager_nml :: single_restart_file_in = .true.,
</pre>
and if they aren't already set like this,
<pre>
&amp;filter_nml :: inf_initial_from_restart    = .false.,    .false.,
&amp;filter_nml :: inf_sd_initial_from_restart = .false.,    .false.,
</pre>
</P>
<P>
After the first single job step, set the values back to the
original settings:
<pre>
&amp;filter_nml :: start_from_restart = .true.,
&amp;filter_nml :: restart_in_file_name = "filter_ics",
&amp;ensemble_manager_nml :: single_restart_file_in = .false.,
</pre>
and if you are using prior inflation,
<pre>
&amp;filter_nml :: inf_initial_from_restart    = .true.,    .false.,
&amp;filter_nml :: inf_sd_initial_from_restart = .true.,    .false.,
</pre>
</P>

<H4>Observations</H4>
<P>
One of the variables in the setup script specifies where the observation
sequence files for the assimilation will be found.  Because DART is
running for only a single assimilation period at a time, the input
<em class=file>obs_seq</em> files for DART need to contain observations 
that are exactly within the assimilation window.  For CAM, we usually run 
it in 6 hour
advances, so the observation sequence files have to contain only 6 hours
of observations.  POP is often run for a day at a time between assimilations,
so the POP observation files need to contain data for a full day.  CLM has
been run both in 6 hour assimilations and daily assimilations.  In any case,
the time period of the observations in each input file must match the
length of time the model runs between assimilations.
</P>
<P>
The DART group has a collection of NCEP atmospheric obs, WOD (World Ocean
Database) ocean obs, and some Land obs already converted and either on
Glade disk on Yellowstone or archived on the HPSS.  
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">Contact the DART group</a> 
if you are interested in what observations are already available.
</P>

<br /><br />
<P> </P>
<A NAME="Running"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H3>Running</H3>
<P> 
The setup script adds a call to the DART <em class=file>filter</em>
program inside the CESM run script, but initially it is <strong>commented out</strong>
(on purpose).  The intent is that you run the CESM case first, without
DART, to ensure that the model is working correctly, has the right files,
good namelist settings, etc.  Then once you are sure CESM is working ok
without DART, edit the <em class=mono>case.run</em> script.  Look for
the string "DART" and inspect the following script section.  You should
see a call to either the <em class=file>assimilate.csh</em> script or
<em class=file>perfect_model_obs.csh</em> script, but it will be
commented out with a leading <em class=mono> # (hash) </em> character.
Remove the # and now you can either run the job again and start
assimilating from the second job step, or you can reset the model
to the initial time before you rerun.
(See <a href="#ResetCESM">Resetting CESM files</a>
below for an easy script to do this.)
</P>
<P> 
The DART run script will convert the CESM NetCDF files into the
DART input format, run the assimilation program, and then convert
the updated values back and overwrite the CESM files. If some error
happens (out of disk space, bad node on the supercomputer, etc)
during the execution of DART, you should use the script described in
<a href="#ResetCESM">Resetting CESM files</a>.  This will
reset the model data back to the start time for this job step
and then you can rerun the run script.
</P>

<A NAME="Archiving"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H3>Archiving Files</H3>

<P>
When you've successfully run a model advance, the output files are saved in <br />
<pre>/glade/scratch/${USER}/archive/$casename</pre>
with a subdirectory for each component.  The DART output files will be in the
'dart' subdirectory, and under that directory will be
'hist', 'logs', and 'rest'.  You'll find the DART diagnostic files and
obs_seq.final files in the 'hist' subdirectory.

<P> </P>
<A NAME="ResetCESM"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H3>Resetting CESM files</H3>

<P>
The DART setup script creates several utility scripts which
are customized for the particular case and location of
files.  They are put into the <em class=mono>caseroot</em> directory.  
One important script is called <em class=file>stage_cesm_files</em>.
</P>
<P>
Running the <em class=mono>stage_cesm_files</em> script
will restore the contents of the <em class=mono>run</em> directory
to a previous step.  If a job dies or an error occurs,
this makes it easier to restart from some previous time.
</P>
<P>
To restart the experiment from the first job step, cd into
the <em class=mono>case</em> directory. If it is not
already false, run:
<pre>./xmlchange CONTINUE_RUN false</pre>
and then run:
<pre>./stage_cesm_files</pre>

The script will remove the current contents of the 
<em class=mono>run</em> directory and restage the files for the 
initial timestep.
</P>
<P>
To restart the experiment from a later job step, cd into
the <em class=mono>case</em> directory. If it is not
already true, run:
<pre>./xmlchange CONTINUE_RUN true</pre>
Then edit the <em class=mono>stage_cesm_files</em> script and
change the <em class=mono>restart_time</em> to be the day and
time that you want to begin running from.  e.g. if
you want to restart at 0Z on Jan 2nd, 2001, you would set:
<pre>set restart_time = 2001-01-02-00000</pre>
Then run:
<pre>./stage_cesm_files</pre>

The script will remove the current contents of the 
<em class=mono>run</em> directory and restage the files for the 
specified time.
</P>

<P>
The script requires that the restart files are still
on disk, either in the <em class=mono>run</em> directory or in
the <em class=mono>archive</em> directory.  If the long term
archiver has moved the files onto tape and deleted
them from disk, they will have to be restored before
running this script.

<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H3>Updating DART files</H3>

<P>
If you make any changes to the DART code and need to recompile
the executables, use the standard DART <em class=file>quickbuild.csh</em>
scripts in the <em class=mono>work</em> directories.  
Once the executables are compiled, use the
<em class=file>refresh_dart_files</em> script in the <em class=mono>caseroot</em> directory
to copy them to the correct location for this case.

<P>
The DART release comes with a collection of Matlab&#174; scripts
for doing diagnostics both on the output observation sequence
file (usually named <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em>) and
also on the state space values (usually found in
<em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> and
<em class=file>Posterior_Diag.nc</em>).  See the
<em class=file>Diagnostics</em> menu item
on the <a href="http://image.ucar.edu/DAReS">DART web pages</a>.

<H3>Miscellaneous and Futures</H3>

<P>
The current interface to the CESM climate modeling system does assimilation
into CAM, POP, and CLM separately.  Therefore at this point there is NOT
a single CESM model_mod that is compiled into a single filter.  However, there 
exists a beta version of a unified model_mod that redirects forward operator
calls to the proper component-specific model_mod, and works around the
conflicts between the naming of the model_mod at the module level.  It would
require a single state vector to fit into the memory space of one process,
which means it would be limited in resolution.  cesm_to_dart and dart_to_cesm
converter prototypes also exist, which pack the data from each model
end-to-end in the state vector.

<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
Software development is ongoing that will allow observations to be
assimilated into all CESM components at once, so low atmosphere
observations can impact state values in both the ocean and land;
surface ocean observations can impact the atmosphere.
There are technical obstacles which are being removed to simply
having this running; once it runs there will undoubtably be
scientific questions that will have to be examined and answered.
