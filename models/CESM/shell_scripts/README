plan of attack for the CESM1_1_setup_script.csh:


configure with a 'B' compset - all components 
fully active

will have to change the number of PEs to match
the number of ensemble members

keep the 'here' document that inserts a call to
a single assimilate.csh script that in turn calls
each of the component assimilate scripts.

start with assimilating only into CAM, so the
calls to the pop and clm assimilate script can
be stubs for now.

start by running with identical ensemble members.

have to run as a continuous 'startup' run.
will have to change start date and the IC
files in each of the user_nl_* namelists


look for name conflicts - the run directory
for filter, the assimilate scripts themselves,
the inflation files, etc.
