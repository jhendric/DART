Tomoko-
  Sorry for the delay in responding to you! You're most welcome
to look at the code, but I warn you that it's far from elegant.
I'd be happy to meet with you briefly to give you an overview.
But, if you'd rather "have at it" on your own, you can find it
in 3 directories: /home/gswm/GSWM/GSWM  (primary source code)
                  /home/gswm/GSWM/lib   (library routines)
                  /home/gswm/GSWM/dat   (input files)
You can probably only access these directories from your hao
account. I haven't run the model in more than a year, but the
script that I used is at /home/hagan/GSWM/gswm.job (for use
with Ben Foster's "submit" command). In that same directory
you'll also find the Makefile as well as the 2 additional input
files (GSWM.inp and waves.inp) that are needed to run the model.
All the best.
