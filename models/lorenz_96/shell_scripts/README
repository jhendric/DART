The scripts in this directory are:

run_filter.csh - 
the main batch script for starting an assimilation run.  will start either
a serial or parallel version of the filter program.  has directives for
the LSF and PBS batch systems.  can also be run interactively.

advance_model.csh - 
normally small models (including this one) are compiled directly with
the filter program to make a single executable that does both the data
assimilation and the model advances.  However, to test the mode where the
model is a separate executable, this script is an example of what is needed.
See the filter.html documentation for async mode 2 for more details.

run_filter_async4.csh - 
an example script for running with both a parallel (MPI) filter program and
a parallel model.  Obviously this model is too small to gain anything from
running in parallel, but for testing and debugging with a small program and
quick turnaround, it has been useful.  This is the main batch script which is
used instead of the simpler run_filter.csh script, and the integrate_model
program should be compiled with MPI in order to do a real test.  See the
filter.html documentation for async mode 4 for more details.

run_filter.lynx.sh - 
a special-purpose script for running on the NCAR Cray system.  Uses
Torque/Moab for the batch system.
