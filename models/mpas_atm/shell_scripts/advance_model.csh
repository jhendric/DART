#
# Shell script to run the MPAS-A(tmostphere) model from DART input.
#
# This script is called by 'filter' or 'perfect_model_obs'
# after the analysis step is done at each cycle.
#
# This script performs the following:
# 1.  Creates a temporary directory to run an MPAS-A realization (see options)
# 2.  Copies or links the files necessary for the model run into the temporary directory
# 3.  Converts DART state vectors to the mpas input at the beginning
# 4.  Updates an MPAS namelist from a template with new dates
# 5.  Runs the MPAS-A model in a restart mode until target time is reached
# 7.  Checks for incomplete runs
# 8.  Converts mpas output to a DART binary file for the next analysis cycle
# 9.  Saves the mpas analysis file for each member if save_analysis = true
#10.  Saves the mpas forecast file for each member if save_forecast = true
#11.  Saves u on the edges if save_analysis = false and use_u_wind = false (for extended forecasts later)
#12.  Saves diagnostic variables at pressure levels (both for analysis and forecast at the cycle)
#     if save_diag_plev = true 
#     For this, you need to create an mpas output (not restart) file at the target time
#     since only mpas output files print out those diagnostic fields at pressure levels.
#
# Note: 1. MPAS is run in a restart mode during the cycles, which means
#          both input and output will be restart files.
#          This also means that one cannot delete temp_dir since we need a
#          place to keep the restart file for each member during the cycle.
#       2. If save_analysis = false and save_forecast = false,
#          the mpas analysis file will be overwritten by 
#          the mpas forecast file to be used as a background for the next analysis cycle.
#       3. dart_to_model expects to have advance_time_present = .true. in input.nml
#          to generate 'mpas_time' for the current and target time info for the forecast run.
#       4. For the required data to run this script, check the section of 'dependencies'.
#
# Arguments for this script (created by 'filter' or 'perfect_model_obs') are:
# 1) the process number of caller,
# 2) the number of ensemble members/state copies belonging to that process, and 
# 3) the name of the control_file for that process.
# 
# If this script finishes and the 'control_file' still exists, it is
# an ERROR CONDITION and means one or more of the ensemble members did
# not advance properly. Despite our best attempts to trap on this
# condition, some MPI installations simply hang, some properly terminate.
#
# This script loops over all the entries in the control_file to advance 
# any/all of the ensemble members.  The number of trips through the 
# loop is the second argument to this script. The control_file contains 
# the information about which ensemble members are to be advanced by THIS TASK.
# Sometimes it may be just one ensemble member, sometimes all of them.
# Read DART/doc/html/filter_async_modes.html and the mpi_intro.html
# for an overview.
