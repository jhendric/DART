This is a uniform PV two-surface QG+1 spectral model contributed
by Rahul Majahan. 

The underlying model is described in:
Hakim, Gregory J., 2000: Role of Nonmodal Growth and Nonlinearity in 
Cyclogenesis Initial-Value Problems. J. Atmos. Sci., 57, 2951â€“2967.


NOTE:

This model counts on a non-standard interface to the obs_model_mod.f90
code in DART/obs_model.  To compile and run this model, make the
following (non-backwards-compatible) two changes:


1:

   !------------- Block for subroutine callable adv_1step interface -----------
   if(async == 0) then

      do while(ens_handle%time(i) < target_time)
         call adv_1step(ens_handle%vars(:, i), ens_handle%time(i))
         ens_handle%time(i) = ens_handle%time(i) + time_step
      end do

! start of new section
   else if(async == 1) then

      call adv_1step(ens_handle%vars(:, i), ens_handle%time(i), target_time)
      ens_handle%time(i) = target_time
! end of new section

   !-------------- End single subroutine callable adv_1step interface ---------

and 2:

! Following is for async options that use shell to advance model
SHELL_ADVANCE_METHODS: if(async > 1) then

! changed from: if(async /= 0) then
