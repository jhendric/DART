This is a WRF 2.2.1 regression test case, which can be used to test 
that code changes do not break existing functions, as well as testing
a wrf/dart initial setup.

The domain is CONUS (the continental United States), 50 km resolution. 

The observation files are the standard prepbufr NCEP observations, from 2007/04/26.

The initial condition and boundary files are compatible with WRF version 2.2.1.
The DART model_mod works fine with WRF 3.0 as well, and if anyone would like to
contribute 3.0 compatible ic and boundary files, we'd be happy to take them.

There are enough files to run with up to 50 ensemble members.

The smaller files are here in this directory.

The large data files (observations, initial conditions and boundary files) 
are on the DART web server, at this http address:

Input files you need to run the test:

obs_seq.tar - 4 observation files      

wrfinput_d01_148403_0.tar - wrf input files for 50 ensemble members

wrfbdy_148403_21600.tar - wrf boundary condition files 
wrfbdy_148403_43200.tar
wrfbdy_148403_64800.tar
wrfbdy_148404_0.tar

input.nml - DART Fortran namelist
namelist.input - WRF Fortran namelist


Executables you will need to build from the DART/WRF distribution:

dart_to_wrf, wrf_to_dart - translates from WRF netcdf files to DART restart, and back
filter - the main DART assimilation program
wakeup_filter - only needed if you must run WRF in parallel mode


Shell scripts that come with the DART/WRF distribution:

runme_filter - shell script that starts the job
advance_model.csh - shell script that advances the WRF model


Files which are there to validate your results:

Posterior_Diag.nc
Prior_Diag.nc
