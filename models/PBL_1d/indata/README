This directory should have a group of netcdf data files in it, but they are
too large to commit to the subversion repository.   Instead, you will need to
get them from the DART web site:

http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/PBL_1d/

Download indata.tgz to this directory and unpack it with:

tar -xvzf indata.tgz

or if your version of tar does not support the z option
(automatic uncompress) then you need to do it in two stages:

unzip indata.tgz
tar -xvf indata.tar
