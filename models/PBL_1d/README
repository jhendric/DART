The PBL_1D directory has been deprecated in favor of using the WRF/DART model
interface.  There is now support for WRF single column mode built into the
standard model_mod in that directory.

There is a page on the DART-Dev (DART Developers) Wiki that describes how to
alter both WRF and DART to work in single-column mode.   If you don't already
have access to this Wiki, email dart at ucar dot edu and ask for access.  If
you have access already, the Wiki page is here:

https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/DARTdev/WRF+Single+Column+Model

If you really want the files that used to be in this directory, check them
out from the Kodiak release of DART.

Contact dart at ucar dot edu for more information or questions.
