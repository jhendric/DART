  !! conventions used:
  !! input is lower case
  !! output is upper case

  !! to solve system of linear eqs on tridiagonal matrix n times n
  !! after Peaceman and Rachford, 1955
  !! a,b,c,d - are vectors of order n 
  !! a,b,c - are coefficients on the LHS
  !! d - is initially RHS on the output becomes a solution vector
