# Script to manage the compilation of all components for this model;
# executes a known "perfect model" experiment using an existing
# observation sequence file (obs_seq.in) and initial conditions appropriate 
# for both 'perfect_model_obs' (perfect_ics) and 'filter' (filter_ics).
# There are enough initial conditions for 80 ensemble members in filter.
# Use ens_size = 81 and it WILL bomb. Guaranteed.
# The 'input.nml' file controls all facets of this execution.
#
# 'create_obs_sequence' and 'create_fixed_network_sequence' were used to
# create the observation sequence file 'obs_seq.in' - this defines 
# what/where/when we want observations. This script does not run these 
# programs - intentionally. 
#
# 'perfect_model_obs' results in a True_State.nc file that contains 
# the true state, and obs_seq.out - a file that contains the "observations"
# that will be assimilated by 'filter'.
#
# 'filter' results in three files (at least): Prior_Diag.nc - the state 
# of all ensemble members prior to the assimilation (i.e. the forecast), 
# Posterior_Diag.nc - the state of all ensemble members after the 
# assimilation (i.e. the analysis), and obs_seq.final - the ensemble 
# members' estimate of what the observations should have been.
#
# Once 'perfect_model_obs' has advanced the model and harvested the 
# observations for the assimilation experiment, 'filter' may be run 
# over and over by simply changing the namelist parameters in input.nml.
#
# The result of each assimilation can be explored in model-space with
# matlab scripts that directly read the netCDF output, or in observation-space.
# 'obs_diag' is a program that will create observation-space diagnostics
# for any result of 'filter' and results in a couple data files that can
# be explored with yet more matlab scripts.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 'preprocess' is a program that culls the appropriate sections of the
# observation module for the observations types in 'input.nml'; the 
# resulting source file is used by all the remaining programs, 
# so this MUST be run first.

#
# If you get a ton of compile ERRORS (not warnings) read on ...
#
# Since a lot of the code is inherited from wrf, it comes with a .F 
# extension even though it is free-format. This makes it necessary to
# compile with flags that force interpretation of free-format.
# They also rely on the autopromotion flag ... arghhh ... -r8
# Intel     -free -r8
# gfortran  -ffree-form -fdefault-real-8
# pathscale -freeform -r8
# pgi       -Mfree -Mr8
# absoft    -ffree  (see the mkmf.template for absoft for more on r8)
