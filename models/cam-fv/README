This directory was imported from lightning:~arellano/Iceland/DART/models/cam.
It's name was changed to reflect the new model_mod.f90 for the Finite Volume core
of CAM.  

The CVS directory will be incorrect, so Tim will need to commit this new directory
and it will have to be re-updated in order to use CVS commands on it.
This should be done into Pre-J, so that imminent users (4/19/06) will get it.
