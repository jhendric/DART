# DART $Id$

# ---------------------
# Purpose
# ---------------------
#
# This script is designed to configure and build a multi-instance CESM model
# that has CLM running under a set of data atmospheres (from a DART/CAM assim).
# and will use DART to assimilate observations at regular intervals.
# This script does not build DART. It works best if the appropriate DART
# executables have been built, however.
#
# This script relies heavily on the information in:
# http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.1/cesm/doc/usersguide/book1.html
#
# ---------------------
# How to set up the script
# ---------------------
# -- Either edit and run this script in the $DART/models/clm/shell_scripts
#    directory where it first appears,
#    or copy it to somewhere that it will be preserved and run it there.
#    It will create a 'case' directory, where the model will be built,
#    and an execution directory, where each forecast and assimilation will
#    take place.  The short term archiver will use a third directory for
#    storage of model output until it can be moved to long term storage (HPSS)
# -- Examine the whole script to identify things to change for your experiments.
# -- Provide any initial files needed by your run:
#       inflation
#       sampling error correction
#       CLM initial ensemble
#       ...
# -- Check to make sure the stream txt files point to the proper stream files for
#       each ensemble member.
# -- Run this script.
# -- Edit the DART input.nml that appears in the $CASEROOT directory.
# -- Submit the job using $CASEROOT/${case}.submit
#
# ---------------------
# Important features
# ---------------------
#
# If you want to change something in your case other than the runtime
# settings, it is safest to delete everything and start the run from scratch.
# For the brave, read
#
# http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.1/cesm/doc/usersguide/x1142.html

# "A hybrid run indicates that CESM is initialized more like a startup, but uses
# initialization datasets from a previous case. This is somewhat analogous to a
# branch run with relaxed restart constraints. A hybrid run allows users to bring
# together combinations of initial/restart files from a previous case (specified
# by $RUN_REFCASE) at a given model output date (specified by $RUN_REFDATE).
# Unlike a branch run, the starting date of a hybrid run (specified by $RUN_STARTDATE)
# can be modified relative to the reference case. In a hybrid run, the model does not
# continue in a bit-for-bit fashion with respect to the reference case. The resulting
# climate, however, should be continuous provided that no model source code or
# namelists are changed in the hybrid run. In a hybrid initialization, the ocean
# model does not start until the second ocean coupling (normally the second day),
# and the coupler does a "cold start" without a restart file.
