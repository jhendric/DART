There are several DART users who have working DART interface code
to the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).  This is a community
ocean model funded by the Office of Naval Research.  See here:

https://www.myroms.org/

for more information on the model.  The lead developers are
at Rutgers and UCLA, but the list of associate developers is
extensive. See here:

https://www.myroms.org/index.php?page=roms_devs

for more information on the developers.

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact 
the DART group at 'dart@ucar.edu' for more information.  We currently
are working with collaborators to optimize the model_mod interface 
and associated scripting to run data assimilation experiments with 
this model.  We may be able to put you in contact with the right 
people to get a copy of the code.
