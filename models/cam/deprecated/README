The files in this directory are deprecated.

The mkmf_trans_* and path_names_trans_* files are for building
the original translation tools between DART initial condition/
restart file format and CAM netCDF file format, and also translating
time between DART and CAM formats.  All are completely superceeded
by the following 3 tools:

dart_to_cam
cam_to_dart
advance_time

If you need to continue to use the original tools, 
copy the source files into DART/models/cam, copy the mkmf_*
and path_names_* files into ../work, and run ./quickbuild.csh
from the work directory.
