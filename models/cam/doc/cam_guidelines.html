<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<H2>DART-CAM Setup Overview</H2>

<P>
This document gives specific help in setting up a
DART-CAM experiment for the first time.
Unless you just came from there, also see the
<a href="../model_mod.html">model_mod</a> documentation
on the code-level interfaces and namelist values for DART-CAM.
</P>

<P>
Usually a run of DART-CAM involves executing multiple sequential
batch job steps, each step consisting of a day's worth
of assimilation.  Between job steps the output from the
previous job step must be saved or moved to be used as
input for the next job step.  Files may need to be archived
or postprocessed.  And finally, DART is a parallel MPI program
and CAM can be compiled as a serial job, an OpenMP parallel job,
or an MPI parallel job.  On some systems an MPI parallel job
cannot start another MPI parallel job, so running both a
parallel DART and parallel CAM as a single job can be hard.
</P>

<P>
The DART distribution comes with some scripts which will probably
have to be customizes for other users.  The <em class=file>shell_scripts</em>
directory contains simple example scripts.  The <em class=file>
full_experiment</em> directory contains scripts which do a full-up
experiment with multiple days and automatic archiving.
</P>

<P>
For parallelism options it is fastest to run a serial (single-threaded)
or OpenMP CAM with a parallel DART.  This is selected by compiling
CAM with the proper options, and then setting the <em class=code>async</em>
namelist variable in the <a href="../../../filter/filter.html#Namelist">&amp;filter_nml</a>
namelist to 2.   If there is not enough memory to run CAM as a serial
job CAM can be compiled as a parallel program using MPI and then the
<em class=code>async</em> value is set to 4 instead.
</P>

<P>
For the short forecasts (6 hours) typically needed for assimilation,
and on machines with at least as many processors as ensemble members,
async=4 is usually much less efficient than async=2.
This is because the start-up phase of an MPI CAM advance is single threaded
and takes much longer than the short integration forward in time.
async=4 (parallel CAM) leaves most of the processors idling for most of the time.
async=2 lets all the start-up phases run at the same time on all of the processors.
The drawback of async=2 is that there may not be enough memory on a single
processor to handle a whole CAM.
</P>

<P>
async=2 and 4 allow users to control the assimilation through a single script,
'job_mpi.csh'.
job_mpi.csh has a section of user set parameters which define many aspects of
the assimilation.  
It uses those parameters to create a series of batch scripts, 
one for each obs_seq.out file that will be assimilated.
Their names have the form [Experiment]_[obs_seq#].script,
the parts of which are defined in job_mpi.csh.
It submits all of those scripts to the batch scheduler,
where they run in succession as resources become available.
Each obs_seq batch script executes the programs layed out in the calling tree (below).
</P>

<P>
There are, no doubt, things missing from these lists, so don't struggle too long
before contacting raeder'at'ucar.edu.
</P>

<P>
The sequence of operations for assimilating a single obs_seq.out file follows.
The functionality of each operation has been restricted to one "domain".
A script/program is specific to:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI> a machine where the experiment is run (e.g. NCARS IBM Power6 'bluefire'); </LI>
   <LI> a model version used in the assimilation (e.g. CAM 4.0.1); </LI>
   <LI> the filter version; </LI>
   <LI> or the experiment being conducted using the choices for the previous 3.</LI>
</UL>

Instructions for setting up a DART/CAM in "stand-alone" mode assimilation.
This section does not describe setting up assimilations within the CESM
framework (available in late 2011?).
</P>

<BR>

<OL TYPE=A>   
   
   <LI>DART
      <OL TYPE=1>
         <LI>Register and check out DART from the 
             <A href="http://www2.image.ucar.edu/forms/dart-software-download">download site</A>.  </LI>
         <LI>In .../DART/mkmf link mkmf.template to 
             the mkmf.template.xxxx which is appropriate for your computer 
             (or make one of your own).  </LI>
         <LI> cd to .../DART/models/cam/work and edit input.nml:preprocess_nml:input_files 
             to choose obs_def source code files to load via the preprocessor.  
<!-- ??? link to obs_def_mod.html? -->
             The default file <em class=file>
             <a href="../../../../obs_def/obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90">
             obs_def/obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90</a></em> will handle 
	     observations from NCEP reanalysis BUFR files.  (Warning: assimilating the
	     obs in the example GPS obs_seq.out file available from the 
             <A HREF="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets">DART Obs_sets site</A>
	     requires loading more than just the obs_def_gps_mod.f90.)</LI>
         <LI>Script DART/models/cam/work/quick_build.csh is recommended for compiling 
             the package.  
	     It is set up to compile and run the preprocessor, 
	     compile filter and wakeup_filter as MPI processes (async=2 and 4),
             and compile all other executables (but not CAM) as single process programs.  
             If you want a single-process filter, quick_build.csh can take -nompi 
             as an argument, which will build filter and wakeup_filter that way.
             The main script job_mpi.csh may need minor modifications to run that way.
             Keep in mind that all of the ensemble members' state vectors will have
             to fit in the memory of a single processor, so this is only suitable
             for low resolution, small ensemble testing.

   <LI> CAM 
      <OL TYPE=1>
   
         <LI> Put the DART modifications 
             (.../DART/models/cam/Cam[version#]_DART_mods.tar),
             and any other CAM modifications you have, 
             in the CAM directory of user-provided modifications.
             CAM's "configure" will use these during compilation, if you tell it to. 
             Configure and compile CAM at the resolution/dynamical core desired.  
             Do this in a directory where all your CAM versions will reside, 
             here called CamCentral.</LI>
<!--             (/home/raeder/Cam3.0/Cam3_0_7_DART_mods) -->
   
   
         <LI>Link the cam executable and config_cache*.xml files into a subdirectory of
             the CAM source code directory  [CamCentral/CAM_version]/models/atm/cam/bld ,
             which I'll call CAM_config_1 (add -mpi for MPI CAM or -omp for OpenMP CAM).  
             Job_mpi.csh has a variable "CAMsrc" that should point to that location. 
             (This location is necessary because run-cam.csh looks for files and programs
             in the parent directory of the directory which has the CAM executable in it.)
             </LI>
   
         <LI>Build a CAM namelist and call it 'namelistin' containing (among the other/default 
             variables defined by the CAM build-namelist):

             In the past (as of 5/15/2011), the released versions of CAM cannot use the GREGORIAN 
             calendar.  This is true for the released versions of CAM4 (4.0.1 from CCSM4) and CAM5 
             (from CESM1.0)
             Fixes for many versions can be found in the Cam[version]_DART_mods.tar files
             included in the DART package.
             Those may be portable into the version of CAM you want to use.
             In order to use the GREGORIAN calendar, CAM must be built with the full 
             ESMF time manager.  It must be built single-threaded if you will use async=2,
             or MPI for async=4.  In addition, check that CAM is actually linking to the 
             time manager you want (the CAM build scripts have their own ideas, and may not
             ask permission to do what they want).
             As a last resort, run experiments which don't cover leap years and use the 
             default calendar = 'NO_LEAP', or make obs_sequence.out files which don't have 
             2/29 on them.
            
             The run-cam.csh script will call the CAM build-namelist script, 
             which will use namelistin to make (a) new namelist(s) with 
             the correct forecast parameters, named 'namelist' (< CAM 3.5) 
             or '{atm,drv,ice,lnd,ocn}_in' (>= CAM 3.5).
             Put it/them into a directory where job_mpi.csh will be able to find it; 
             something like  CamCentral/CAM_version/models/atm/cam/bld/CAM_config_1.  </LI>

         <LI>Confirm that you have access to all the input files whose names are
             generated by build-namelist in 'namelist' or '{atm,drv,ice,lnd,ocn}_in', 
             or suitable replacements.</LI>
   
         <LI>Put an appropriate CAM initial file in CAM_config_1 and call it caminput.nc.
             Put a matching CLM initial file there and call it clminput.nc.
             (Matching is important; CAM checks that the CLM initial file has the expected
              grid parameters.)
             Only the grid information is used from these files, so their dates don't matter.</LI>

<A NAME="INITIALFILES"></A>
<HR>
<H2>CAM Initial Ensembles</H2>
<P>

Strategies for generating an initial ensemble from which DART can start.
<BR>

All of these strategies require converting CAM initial file(s) into 
      filter_ic.#### files, which is done by the 
      <A HREF="../cam_to_dart.html"> same method.  </A>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI> MINIMAL WORK; Get an ensemble of filter and CAM/CLM[/CICE] initial files
     from someone else (DART has a few dates for a few model cores and resolutions
     <A HREF="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets">here</A>.
     This limits the investigations you can undertake,
     but is the fastest and cheapest way to start assimilating.
</LI>

<LI> MINIMAL CAM COMPUTING; an assimilation can be started from a single CAM (+CLM[+CICE])
     initial file.  
     The single model state is randomly perturbed to make as many ensemble members
     as are requested in the <em class=code>ens_size</em> variable 
     in the <em class=code>filter_nml</em> namelist.
     Create a <em class=file>filter_ic </em> file from the CAM initial file (dart_to_cam.f90).
     Create an <em class=file>obs_seq.out </em> file which has a single observation 
     with a large observational error variance, 
     valid at least a week after the start date for the spin-up.
     This will make the ensemble advance long enough to balance the fields,
     without being perturbed by the assimilation of any observations.
<PRE>
&amp;filter_nml
   ...
   start_from_restart       = .false.,
   restart_in_file_name     = "filter_ic",
   ...
/
&amp;model_nml
   ...
   pert_names         = 'T       ','US      ','VS      '
   pert_sd           = 1.0d0,2.0d0,2.0d0
   ...
/
</PRE>
Note that <em class=code>start_from_restart</em> is false 
("don't start from a pre-existing *ensemble*"), 
but a restart file (<em class=file>filter_ic</em>) 
is still needed for filter to have something realistic to perturb.
<em class=code>pert_names</em> specifies which fields will be perturbed.  
CAM field names are used.
<em class=code>pert_sd</em> > 0 allows each point of the pert_names fields of each ensemble member
to be randomly perturbed with a standard deviation of pert_sd.
Other fields can be used, but moisture variables are tricky because of their variation
with height by orders of magnitude.  
Regardless of which fields are specified, the spin-up period
will allow the fields to come into balance with respect to the model, 
so the perturbations will propagate into all fields.
</LI>

<LI>
FULL FUNCTION ENSEMBLE; In order to have, on hand, initial ensembles
of any practical size, for any date of the year, we recommend the following.
Scripts for doing this are available in .../DART/models/cam/make_ensemble.
See the README there for more details.
They are not highly documented or elegent, but offer a starting point.
Make 20 successive 1-year free CAM runs (MPI CAM highly recommended, NO_LEAP calender), 
saving the initial files every 5 days.
Then pull together all of the, e.g., Jan 6ths (00Z) into a 20 member ensemble
(numbered 1...20).
Don't forget the CLM initial files, and possibly 
the CICE restart file(s):
<!-- ??? Update/replace the following for cice restarts that are NetCDF
         and need no special treatment 
(CAM 3.6.v, v < 57) tarred together into file iceinput_#.tar: 
<UL> 
<LI>bld-ICs-1.cice.r.1986-01-06-00000;        renamed as iceinput</LI>
<LI>bld-ICs-1.cice.r.aero.1986-01-06-00000;   keep this name!    </LI>
<LI>bld-ICs-1.cice.r.volpn.1986-01-06-00000;  keep this name!    </LI>
</UL>  -->
After CAM 3.6.57 there is only one, NetCDF, CICE initial/restart file (yea!),
which is called iceinput_#.nc within DART-CAM.
Repeat for each date at which there are initial files and archive them.
When you need an ensemble of, say 60 members for June 1 
then retrieve the 20 members from each of May 26, May 31, and June 5,
renumbering them 1,...,60.
Convert each of the CAM initial files into a filter_ic.#### file (cam_to_dart.f90).

A typical pathname for a restart file in my case would be:
/scratch/raeder/T21x80/Taper1/obs_0003/DART/filter_ic#
                |      |      |        |    restart file(s)
                |      |      |        DART restart file directory
	        |      |      Obs_seq (3rd obs_seq.out of a series starting at 1)
                |      Experiment (reduced influence of obs above 150 hPa)
                Central directory (resolution x num_ens_members)

You may also want to make a subdirectory within Experiment 
for each set of obs_space postscript and .dat files created by obs_diag and matlab.

<A NAME="HINTS"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Helpful Hints</H2>

<P>
In the following, MPI filter uses all of the requested processors.
There is flexibility in how the ensemble of CAMs uses them.
The choice of async and number of processors to use 
will depend on the memory available on each node, 
as well as the number of processors available.
See also models/cam/doc/html/filter_async_modes.html in the DART code tree, after registering.
</P>

<P>
For async = 2 use the ensemble size, available compute nodes, processors/node  ,
and memory/node to figure how many nodes to request.  
Make this request in job_mpi.csh.  
For example, on a machine with 8 processors/node, and running an assimilation 
with an ensemble of 80 members (recommended), it's efficient to request 5 (or 10) nodes.
This will advance the single-process CAMs in 2 (or 1) batches of 40 (80).  
That's assuming that each node has the memory to accomodate 8 CAMs.
</P>

<P>
async = 4 runs an ensemble of pure-MPI CAMs 1 at a time and is usually a poor choice for CAM 
assimilations because the start-up process for CAM is single process
and takes significant time.  
So all but one of the processors wait a long time while CAM is setting itself up,
then they all work for a short time to make the short forecast, 
and then repeat for the next ensemble member.
</P>

<P>
async = 3 is part way between async = 2 and 4.  
It is part of an experimental version of the code which is in 
the general release yet.
CAM must be compiled with pure OpenMP parallelism.
Then the MPI filter can execute multiple CAMs simultaneously on several processors each.
The start-up for each is still a single process, 
but a smaller fraction of the processors wait.  
This mode will make reasonably efficient use of hundreds of processors.
</P>

<P>
Each batch of restart data can be saved to a mass store using (a modified) 
auto_re2hpss and retrieved using models/cam/full_experiment/hpss2restart.  
Execute the commands with no arguments to see instructions.  
Then package files of each ensemble member together, and then bundle batches 
of ensemble members together for efficient storage in a directory named 
similarly to the one where they exist on the main computer.
</P>

<!-- If you're not running job_mpi.csh as a batch job,
     run it as 'nohup ./job_mpi.csh >& /dev/null &', to protect the job from being cutoff
     by the closure of the window in which it was executed. -->

<P>
Modify and use alias 'rmtemp' to remove the temporary files from
the central directory where the experiment is run, after a run bombs and
before running another experiment.
</P>
<pre>
alias rmtemp 'rm *_ud* *_ic[0-9]* cam_*_temp* c[al]minput_[1-9]*.nc  \
              *control filter_ic_old* obs_seq.out times'
</pre>
<P>
Needless to say, be careful that you don't name files you want to keep in such a way that
they'll be deleted by this.
</P>
