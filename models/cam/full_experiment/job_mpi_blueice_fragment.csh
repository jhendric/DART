# For the IBM/blueice machine. This fragment can be dropped into the job_mpi.csh script
# to specifically schedule which mpi tasks run on which nodes. Since cores on the same
# nodes share memory, if running one mpi task per core uses too much memory, everything
# slows down drastically.  Better to run fewer tasks per node (e.g. 7 tasks on an 8 core
# node) since then each task gets more memory (the memory on these nodes is not
# partitioned by core; it is completely shared and a single task can take over all
# the memory if you let it).

      if ($num_procs == 96) then
         # This environment variable tells how many processors on each node to use
         # I want 80 = 2*14 + 4*13
