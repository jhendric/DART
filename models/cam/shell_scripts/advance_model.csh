# advance_model.csh
#
# Script to advance one ensemble member one filter "time step"
# when the model advance is executed as a separate process.
# Called by filter_server.csh.
# Calls run-pc.csh, the CAM execution script.
# Calls 3 translation routines to translate time and model state.
# Runs on one of the compute nodes allotted to filter_server.csh.
#
# Arguments are the process number of caller, the number of state copies
# belonging to that process, and the name of the filter_control_file for
# that process

# OLD OLD OLD -- this is no longer true.
# Has either 3 or 4 input arguments.
# arg#1  is the name of the CENTRALDIR
# arg#2  is the ensemble member number
# arg#3  is the name of the directory that is used to advance this particular 
#        instance of the model. Each ensemble member (i.e. each execution of CAM)
#        runs in its own, unique directory that is emptied upon entry.
# arg#4  is optional, and contains the 'machine file' for multi-threaded 
#        instances of CAM.
