# Standard script for use in assimilation applications
# where the model advance is executed as a separate process.
# Can be used with most low-order models and the bgrid model which
# can be advanced using the integrate_model executable.

# This script copies the necessary files into the temporary directory
# and then executes the fortran program integrate_model.

# Arguments are the process number of caller, the number of state copies
# belonging to that process, and the name of the filter_control_file for
# that process
set process = $1
set num_states = $2
set control_file = $3

# Get unique name for temporary working directory for this process's stuff
set temp_dir = 'advance_temp'${process}

# Create a clean temporary directory and go there
\rm -rf  $temp_dir

# Get the program and input.nml
cp ../integrate_model .
cp ../input.nml .

# Loop through each state

   # integrate_model is hardcoded to expect input in temp_ic and it creates
   # temp_ud as output.
