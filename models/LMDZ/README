There are several DART users who have working DART interface code
to the LMDZ atmospheric general circulation model.  This model is
developed and supported by the Laboratorie de Meteorologie Dynamique
which is located at three French universities, one in Palaiseau and 
two in Paris.

See here:

http://lmdz.lmd.jussieu.fr/?set_language=en

for more information on the model.  

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact 
the DART group at 'dart@ucar.edu' for more information.  We currently do
not have a copy of the model_mod interface code nor any of the scripting 
required to run an assimilation, but we may be able to put you in contact 
with the right people to get it.
