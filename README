Welcome to DART, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed.


Documentation is in HTML format in the doc subdirectory.

Tutorial materials are in PDF and Framemaker format in the
tutorial subdirectory.


Quick-start for the impatient:

Go into the mkmf directory and copy over the closest
mkmf.template.compiler.system file into mkmf.template.

Edit to set the NETCDF directory location if not in
/usr/lib (which is hardly ever true).

Go into models/lorenz_96/work and run workshop_setup.csh.
If it compiles and runs 'perfect_model_obs' and 'filter',
you've got a working setup.  Congrats.

other models already using DART or for how to add
your model or observation types.
