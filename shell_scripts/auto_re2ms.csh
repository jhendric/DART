# script for copying 1 day/obs_seq of restart files to the mass store.
# CAM,CLM, and possibly filter_ic for each ensemble member are lumped together
# so that we can retrieve a subset of the ensemble members for a new experiment.
# Then it lumps together ensemble members into batches to reduce the number of files.

# change for lightning?
