# Script to guide in getting required files for running
# a cam model DART assimilation starting in the PWD.

# Assumes execution from .../cam_test

# this is written for anchorage [dart]

# Should I have a call to run-pc.csh in here to do the 0th iteration;
# create the first caminput.nc and clminput.nc, using original files in /fs/cgd
# Then cam would exist for all the "elements", and I wouldn't have to 
# manually create c[al]minput.nc and namelists before running the filter.
#   YES, but later
# Or would it work better in init_advance_model.csh?
#   NO

# set $case = the case and $model = the model we're running
set case = T5
set model = cam2.0.1
# output info for advance_model.csh to use
echo $case $model > casemodel
# set caseinfo = `cat casemodel`
