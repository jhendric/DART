Doxygen automatic documentation generation.

To create html pages from the DART source:

Copy these 3 files into any model's "work" directory, and run
'gendocs'.  You must have doxygen installed somewhere on your
search path.  The 'gendocs' script will generate a single
index.html page, plus directories of documentation for each
executable that has an mkmf_xxx and path_names_xxx pair of
files in the work directory.  All documentation will be
created and put under $DART/doxygen/model_name.

To use the documentation:

Open the $DART/doxygen/model_name/index.html and click
on any executable name.

Click on the triangle in front of 'Data Types List' to open the list.

There is a second 'Data Types List'.  Click on that triangle in
front of the second 'Data Types List' to open the list. You
should see a list of modules.

If you click on the text 'Data Types List' instead of the triangle,
you get a different view of all the modules with the defined data
types listed.

Click on one of the modules.  You will then see the reference page
for that module, with the public types, functions, subroutines,
and private types, functions, and subroutines.  

Any text in blue can be clicked on and it will take you to the
reference page for that type, function or subroutine.
