This file describes how to compile and use the NCEP BUFRLIB software, which is
described in detail at http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/NCO/DMQAB/Decoders/BUFRLIB/,
and whose usage is governed by the terms and conditions of the disclaimer
viewable at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.html

The NCEP BUFRLIB software has been compiled and tested across a wide variety
of UNIX platforms, including AIX 4.x, HP-UX 9.x and 10.x, IRIX 6.x, SunOS 5.x,
UNICOS 9, and even RedHat Linux 5.2; thus, it should port with minimal
difficulty to any UNIX system.  In general, no special FORTRAN compiler flags
are required, and therefore the simple command:

    $FC -c *.f

where $FC points to the local FORTRAN 77 compiler, should suffice for most
systems.  However, it is recommended to then assemble all of the compiled
object files into an archive library, via:

    ar crv $BUFRLIB *.o

where $BUFRLIB points to the desired pathname for the BUFRLIB archive library.
This archive library can then be easily linked whenever the user's application
program is subsequently compiled on the local system.
