# DESCRIPTION:
#
#  This script is used to generate daily (3:01Z to 3:00Z of next day) decoded 
#  NCEP reanalysis PREPBUFR text/ascii data.

#--------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  This script is used to generate daily (3:01Z to 3:00Z of next day) decoded 
#  NCEP reanalysis PREPBUFR text/ascii data.
#  It should be run only for days within a single month.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------
# USER SET PARAMETERS

# if daily is 'yes', 4 6-hour files will be processed and a single, 1-day
# output file will be created.  if daily is set to anything else, then
# each 6-hour input file will be converted to a single 6-hour output file.

set    daily = yes

# if convert is 'yes', then the big-endian BUFR files will be converted
# to little-endian files before processing. this is needed if you are running
# on a machine that uses Intel chips (e.g. linux clusters, altix, pcs, etc).
# it is not needed for ibm power system.  any value other than 'yes' will
# skip the convert step.

set  convert = no 

# starting year, month, day, and ending day.  this script does not allow
# you to do more than a single month at a time, but does handle the last
# day of the month, leap day in feb, and the last day of the year correctly.
# this version of the conversion tool takes up to 3 hours of observations
# from the day *following* the end day, so you must have at least the 6Z
# file from one day beyond the last day for this to finish ok.

# files will be located in subdirectories by month, with the names following
# the pattern YYYYMM, and then inside the subdirectories, the files are
# named by the pattern 'prepqmYYYYMMDDHH'.  for example, if the dir below
# is the default ../data, then the 6Z file for jan 1st, 1989 would be:
#  ../data/198901/prepqm1989010106
# if the prepqm files do *not* follow this pattern, you may have to edit
# the BUFR_file and BUFR_out variables below inside the loop of the script.
# year is 4 digits; month, day, hour are 1 or 2 digits.  yy, mm, dd, hh are
# all truncated or padded to be exactly 2 digits.
