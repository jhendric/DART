This directory contains two sets of programs for converting NCEP BUFR files, which
contain observational data, into DART obs_seq file format.


The first is in the prep_bufr directory.  This program converts the raw data files
into an intermediate text format.  

The second is in the create_real_obs program, which has the source in this directory
but is built with scripts in the 'work' subdirectory.  It reads the intermediate text
files and outputs DART obs_seq file format.


For documentation on each part of the process, see:

 1. prep_bufr/prep_bufr.html
 2. create_real_obs.html
