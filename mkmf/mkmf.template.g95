# Most likely NETCDF (and maybe LIBS) will need to be customized for your site
#
#
# Building DART with open-source software:
#
# All the parts (except matlab, which is optional and only used to display results)
# needed to build and run the DART package are now possible to get free from
# the open-source community.  To compile and run DART, you will need:
#
#
# 1. The g95 compiler.  See this web page for
#    information on supported platforms and downloads:
#      http://g95.sourceforge.net/
#
#    (Note that the g95 compiler is a separate project from the 'gfortran'
#    compiler.  gfortran is part of the GNU compiler development efforts;
#    g95 is a separately developed and supported project.)
#
#
# 2. The netCDF software library package.  See:
#      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf
#
#    The 3.6.2 version compiled for us with this:
#
#     ./configure CC=gcc FC=g95
#     make check
#     make install
#
#    You can add the argument --prefix=/dir to configure to make the install
#    location for the includes and libs someplace other than /usr/local.
#
#
# If you want to try the *optional* parallel execution option, you will
# need a version of the MPI libs.  There are at least two open source options:
#
# 3. For parallel execution, OpenMPI 1.2 from:
#       http://www.open-mpi.org/
#
#     or mpich from:
#       http://http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/
#
# Note that MPI IS NOT REQUIRED to build and run DART.
#
# IF YOU HAVE MORE CURRENT COMPILER INFORMATION, PLEASE SHARE IT WITH US.

# DISCUSSION ABOUT NETCDF. DART works with both V3 and V4 flavors of netCDF.
# Some V4 installations also require the HDF5 libraries. Some don't.
# Some netCDF installations require both -lnetcdff and -lnetcdf, some only
# require -lnetcdf. The permutations make it difficult to cover the possible
# installations. Here are some candidates, you might just have to resort to
# trial and error:
# LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf
# LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
# LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf           -lcurl -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lm
# LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf -lcurl -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz -lm
#
# If you get an error "ld: library not found for -lnetcdff" (note 2 f's),
# remove it from the LIBS line. The same is true for any library. If 'ld'
# does not complain - it worked.

# If your NETCDF environment variable is not set correctly,
# uncomment the following line and set value to where lib and include
# are found for the netcdf files that match this compiler.
#
# NETCDF = /opt/local

INCS = -I$(NETCDF)/include
LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
FFLAGS  = -O2 $(INCS)
LDFLAGS = $(FFLAGS) $(LIBS)
