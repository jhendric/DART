# NETCDF and LIBS need to be customized for your site
#  here are some values for the local NCAR machines:
#    ocotillo       NETCDF = /usr/local/netcdf-pgi
#    fisher         NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf-3.6.0-p1-cc-c++-pgf90.6.1-1
#    lightning 6.0  NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf/3.5.1-pgi6.0-64   
#    lightning 6.2  NETCDF = /home/lightning/thoar/netcdf-3.6.0p1-pgcc-pgCC-pgf90-6.2
#    coral 32bit    NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf-3.6.0p1-pgcc-pgf90-6.0-8-32
#    coral 64bit    NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf-3.6.0p1-cc-pgf90-6.0-8-64
#    bangkok        NETCDF = /usr/local/netcdf-pgi
#
# if you switch between machines frequently, you can leave
# the NETCDF variable unset here and set it in your environment.
#
# FFLAGS   useful for benchmarking
#    -Ktrap=fp               trap floating point exceptions and EXIT
#    -pc 64                  use 64bit register precision (useful for comparison)
#    -v                      verbose compile
#    -O0                     no optimization
#
# FFLAGS   useful for speed
#    -fastsse                'general optimal flags for SSE, SSE2 chipsets'
#    -Minline                
#    -Knoieee                don't perform IEEE arithmetic (faster, see note) 
#    -Minfo=loop,inline      emit info about loop optmztn and inlining to stderr
#
# FFLAGS   useful for non-conforming code
#    -Mr8                    promote all reals to real*8
#    -Mextend                Allow source lines up to 132 characters
#    -Mfixed                 Assume fixed-format source
#    -Mfree                  Assume free-format source
#    -Mbyteswapio            turn big_endian to little_endian or vice-versa
#
# NOTE: 'noieee' "... produces results that differ from the correctly rounded 
#                     result by no more than 3 units in the last place."
#                            
# DIRECT ACCESS ... reclen ... should be in units of 'bytes'. 
#                   If runtime environment parameter FTNOPT is set to "vaxio",
#                   the units are number of words.
#
# If you add the -Mprof=func flag to get profiling information, you must
# add it to both FFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
