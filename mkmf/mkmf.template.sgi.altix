#
# NETCDF and LIBS needs to be customized for your site -- 
#  this file is known to work on the COLUMBIA cluster at NASA Ames,
#  and the ORIGIN cluster at the NSSL in Norman.
#
# the location of NETCDF on these two machines is: 
#     columbia    NETCDF = /opt/pd/netcdf/3.6.0-p1/
#     origin      NETCDF = /home/wicker/Software/netcdf-3.6.0-p1
#
# For MPI programs you still use the 'ifort' compiler but add the
#   '-lmpi' flag to link in the mpi libraries and also mark the
#   executable as an MPI job.  This is different from most Linux
#   clusters which have a separate 'mpif90' script to add the MPI
#   specific include dirs and link libraries.
#
# FFLAGS   use when you like, if you must
#     -fpp     run Fortran preprocessor on source files prior to compilation
#     -free    interpret source as free-format, regardless of file extension
#     -r8      specify default real size ...
#
# FFLAGS   useful for debugging
#     -C       (paritally) enable extensive runtime error checking
#     -g       include symbol table
#     -mp1     Improves floating-point precision and consistency.  This option
#              disables fewer optimizations and has less impact on performance
#              than -mp or -fltconsistency
#     -check all       [bounds,overflow,format,args]
#     -check noarg_temp_created   turns off this one
#     -[no]warn <keywords>
#           specifies the level of warning messages issued.
#           keywords:  [no]alignments, [no]argument_checking, [no]declarations,
#                      [no]errors, [no]fileopt, [no]general, [no]ignore_loc, 
#                      [no]stderrors, [no]truncated_source, [no]uncalled,
#                      [no]uninitialized, [no]unused, [no]usage
#
# FFLAGS   useful for benchmarking
#     -O0      disable optimizations
#
# FFLAGS   useful for production
#     -O2      optimize
