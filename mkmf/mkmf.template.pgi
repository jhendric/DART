# FFLAGS   useful for benchmarking
#    -Ktrap=fp               trap floating point exceptions and EXIT
#    -pc 64                  use 64bit register precision (useful for comparison)
#    -v                      verbose compile
#    -O0                     no optimization
#
# FFLAGS   useful for speed
#    -fastsse                'general optimal flags for SSE, SSE2 chipsets'
#    -Minline                
#    -Knoieee                don't perform IEEE arithmetic (faster, see note) 
#    -Minfo=loop,inline      emit info about loop optmztn and inlining to stderr
#
# FFLAGS   useful for non-conforming code
#    -Mfree                  regardless of file extension, process as free format
#    -Mr8                    promote all reals to real*8
#
# NOTE: 'noieee' "... produces results that differ from the correctly rounded 
#                 result by no more than 3 units in the last place."
#
# If you use -Mprof=func for profiling information, you must add it to
# both FFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
