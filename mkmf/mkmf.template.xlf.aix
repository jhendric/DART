# typical use with mkmf
# mkmf -t mkmf.template.xxxx -c"-Duse_netCDF" ...
#
# Our installation has the system of compiling the libraries with both 64 bit
# and 32 bit addressing, and incorporates the 'autopromotion' flags into
# the library directory node. Hence, the netCDF libraries compiled with
# 64bit addressing will be in /usr/local/lib64  and if no autopromotion
# flags are set, the libraries will be installed into u
# /usr/local/lib64/r4i4 -- TJH. 
#
# FFLAGS   used all the time
#   -qsuffix=f=f90:cpp=F90      invoke the preprocessor at right time
#   -q64                        use 64bit addressing
#   -qarch=auto                 optimize for _this_ architecture
#   -qmaxmem=-1 
#
# FFLAGS   useful for debugging
#   -C                        array bounds checking
#   -qfullpath -g             for totalview
#
# FFLAGS   useful for benchmarking
#   -O0                       turn off optimization
#
# FFLAGS   useful for production
#   -O2                       turn up optimization (at your own risk)
#
# FFLAGS   we no longer use 
#   -qdpc                     double precision constants
#   -qrealsize=8              autopromote (more than you think)
#   -qintsize=4               ditto

# sidd (ncar consulting) says the loader flags we used to have here
# (-bmaxdata:2000000000 and -bmaxstack:2000000000) were good for the 32-bit
# version of the compiler, to use more memory.  BUT, for the 64-bit version
# it was actually restricting the max memory for the job.  so they're gone.
# (and interestingly, compiling filter like that and then starting another
# job in async=2 mode restricted the subjob as well, no matter how it was
# compiled -- inheriting limits in the proc table at exec time?)  anyway,
# we removed them.
